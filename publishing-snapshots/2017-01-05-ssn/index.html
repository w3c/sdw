      <p>The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as "SSN" or
        sometimes "SSNO") is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the
        observations they make. SSN is published in a
        modular architecture that supports the judicious use of "just enough"
        semantics for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large
        scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure,
        citizen observers, and the Web of Things. SSN is described and examples

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Sensor observations are a major source of data published on the Web.
        Nonetheless, publishing, searching, reusing, and integrating these data
        requires more than just the observation values. Of equal importance is
        information about the studied feature of interest, such as a river, the
        observed property, such as flow velocity, and the sampling strategy,
        such as the specific locations at which the velocity was measured. The
        sampling location, instrumentation, and information about the deployment
        of the sensors on a platform may also be required for proper
        interpretation. OGC's Sensor Web Enablement standards [[OandM]],
        [[SensorML]] provide a means to annotate
        sensors and their observations. However, these standards are not yet
        integrated and aligned with W3C Semantic Web technologies and Linked
        Data in particular, that are a key driver for creating and maintaining a
        global and densely interconnected graph of data. The W3C Semantic Sensor
        Network Incubator Group (SSN) addressed these issues by developing an
        ontology that spans multiple OGC standards and other specifications. </p>
      <p>
        The SSN is designed to offer four identifiable and coherent perspectives
        or use cases for sensing, each of which may be used either independently
        or in concert with the others. These perspectives are

        evolving from way back in 2002 provides distinct provider- and
        consumer-focused standards; SensorML (dealing with sensors) and O&amp;M
        (dealing with observations and data), as well as an explicit treatment
        of sampling and the relation with feature-of-interest.</p>

      <h2>Developments since the initial 2009 publication of SSN</h2>
      <p class="issue" data-number="44"> Justify why we are changing SSN at
        all</p>
      Drawing on considerable implementation experience with SSN since it was
      first published, it is modified to solve some known problems and to
      reflect developments in the Linked Data environment. An important one of
      these developments is the growth of interest in Internet of Things, where
      SSN has been experimented with but has been observed to be too big, too
      dependent on OWL reasoning, and missing some key concepts such as
      Actuation.
      Specifically,
      <ol>
        <li> The namespace has changed to a permanent W3C address. </li>
        <li> For the purpose of modularization, a new ontology derived from SSN
          has been developed. See section <a href="#Modularization">Modularization</a>
          for a detailed description on how the parts relate.
          <p class="issue" data-number="102"> What is the new core ontology
            module to be called?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The SSN previously imported the DOLCE ultralite ontology (DUL) and
            many SSN terms inherited from DUL terms. This has been redesigned
            into two separate ontology modules so that SSN can be
            used quite independently of DUL if desired. Some of the alignments
            have been reconsidered. Those parts of SSN that
            use DUL terms have been separated into the <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/dul/">SSN Alignment with DUL ontology.</a> </p>
          <!--
<p  class="issue"  data-number="45">This DUL alignment does not yetreflect the recent change to the namespace of DUL itself.</p>
<p>Please see section for more information. </p> -->
        </li>
        <li> Class Sensor has been moved up to become a direct subclass of
          dul:Object instead of dul:PhysicalObject. This is not expected to
          affect existing uses of SSN due to dul:Object being a direct parent
          class of
          dul:PhysicalObject. This corrects the dul alignment to match the
          intended scope of ssn:Sensor as it is described in the rdfs:comment
          property.
          <!-- 
<p  class="issue"  data-number="46">The movement of Sensor to become adirect subclass of dul:Object has been discussed but postponed by
the Working Group</p></li> -->
        </li>
        <li> Many rdfs:comment annotation properties have changed slightly to
          improve explanation or to correct minor errors.
          <p class="issue" data-number="47">A thorough check and rewrite where

      <h2>Modularization</h2>
      <p> </p>
      <p>One of the major issue <span data-dobid="hdw">practitioners</span>
        using the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology as defined in the XG is
        its complexity, partly due to the layering underneath the DOLCE
        UltraLite upper level ontology. In response to this, the new Semantic
        Sensor Network ontology offers several ontology subsets that are
        distinguished mainly through their ontological commitments. This section
        explains the rationale and
        method for modularizing SSN, i.e. offering several ontology files that
        are similar in their domain of discourse, but with different ontological
        commitments, suitable to several use cases.</p>
      <p>Ontology modularization is a common method used in ontology
        engineering to segment an ontology into smaller parts. In general,
        ontology modularization aims at providing users of ontologies with the
        knowledge they require, reducing the scope as much as possible to what
        is strictly necessary in a given use case. Two main categories of
        ontology modularization can be distinguished.</p>
      <p>The first category comprises those approaches that focus on the
        composition of existing ontologies by means of integrating and mapping
        ontologies, most commonly through <code>owl:import</code> statements.
        OWL import has a direction from a source ontology to a target ontology,
        and although it is transitive, it only supports knowledge propagation in
        one direction, i.e. the importing ontology captures all the meaning of
        the imported terms used, i.e., it includes all axioms relevant to the
        meaning of these terms, however, the imported ontology may not capture
        any of the semantics of the importing ontology.</p>
      <p>The second category comprises of mapping approaches that aim to
        partition and extract parts of ontologies as modules. These mapping
        approaches are not necessarily directional, but most approaches of
        ontology extraction rely on the directionality of the imported modules.
        The main feature of an
        ontology module under the second category is that it is self-contained,
        i.e., the module captures the meaning of the imported terms used by
        including all axioms relevant to the meaning of these terms. This means,
        that the result of certain reasoning tasks such as subsumption or query
        answering within a single module should be possible and result in the
        same answers without the need to access other modules of the ontology.</p>
      <p>In fact in [[Cuenca-Grau-et-al-2009]] it has been proven that in OWL DL,
        which is a syntactical variant of the Description Logic SHOIN, checking
        whether an ontology is in fact a module of an ontology given a
        vocabulary is an undecidable problem. </p>
      <p> In order to ensure this property, a solution has to be found for
        concepts in the ontology module that inherit object properties from
        concepts that are not in the module. One solution proposed by Cuenca
        Grau <i>et al</i> is to include the bottom concept for all such missing
        concepts. Another solution is to change the domain and range of an
        object property. Our modularization approach uses two different methods
        depending on the directionality of the segmentation.</p>
      <figure><img alt="Ontology Modules" src="images/modular_ontology.png" />
      <figcaption>Overview of the modules of the SSN ontology. The
        layering of the rings represents a vertical segmentation, as follows:</figcaption></figure>
      <h3> Vertical Segmentation</h3>
      <p>Vertical modules build upon each other, i.e. they directionally <code>owl:import</code>
        lower level modules. If a higher level module is used without importing
        its lower levels it may lead to inconsistencies or at least it will lead
        to different answers when reasoning over the module compared with
        reasoning over its complete stack of vertical ontology modules. However,
        lower level modules are independent of their higher level modules and
        logically consistent.</p>
      <p>For example, the Dolce UltraLite Alignment ontology imports the SOSA
        ontology and the Semantic Sensor Network ontology. However, in
        reverse, neither SOSA nor SSN import the Dolce-UltraLite Alignment
        ontology. This makes SOSA, with its lightweight semantics, truly independent of
        vertical modules that add more expressivity and further ontological commitments.</p>
      <p>Note that higher level here is not to be confused with upper level
        ontologies. Upper level ontologies are general knowledge ontologies that
        can be directionally imported in many domains, whereas our definition of
        higher level ontologies here refers to an ontology that extends one or
        several ontology modules to capture a larger part of a knowledge domain
        and/or combine knowledge domains.</p>

      <h2>The SOSA ontology</h2>
      <section>
        <h2 id="sosa-introduction">Introduction</h2>
        The Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) ontology is one of
        the modules provided by the Semantic Sensor Network ontology. It acts as
        the core building block of SSN around which all other classes and
        relationships evolve. SOSA is designed in a way that supports standalone
        usage of the ontology, particularly for applications that merely require
        light-weight specifications such as many Linked Datasets, the Internet
        Of Things, citizen science, Schema.org-style semantic enrichment of data
        repositories, and so forth. At the same time, it acts as minimal
        interoperability fallback level between these applications and their
        resulting data and those that make use of the full SSN, i.e., SOSA
        defines those classes and properties for which data that can be safely
        exchanged across all uses of the SSN. </section>
      <section>
        <h2 id="sosa-background">Background</h2>
        <p>The initial <em>W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group </em>ontology
          (SSN) was built around an ontology design pattern called the <em>Stimulus
            Sensor Observation</em> (SSO) pattern [[SSO-Pattern]]. The SSO was
          developed as a minimal and common ground for heavy-weight ontologies
          for the use on the Semantic Sensor Web as well as to explicitly
          address the need for light-weight semantics requested by the Linked
          Data community. The SSO was also aligned to the <em>DOLCE+DNS
            Ultralite </em>upper ontology (DUL). </p>
        <p>The new SSN described in this document is based on a revised and
          expanded version of this pattern, namely the <em>Sensor, Observation,
            Sample, and Actuator</em> (SOSA) ontology. Similar to the original
          SSO, SOSA acts as a central building block for the SSN but puts more
          emphasis on light-weight use and the ability to be used standalone.
          The axiomatization also changed to provide an experience more related
          to Schema.org. Notable differences include the usage of the Schema.org
          <code>domainIncludes</code> and <code>rangeIncludes</code> annotation properties that provide an
          informal semantics compared to the inferential semantics of their
          OWL-2 counterparts. In line with the changes implemented for the new
          SSN, SOSA also drops the direct DUL alignment although an optional
          alignment can be achieved via the SSN-DUL alignment provided in
          Section 7. SOSA is also more explicit in its support for virtual
          sensors and human sensors than SSO. Finally, and most notably, SOSA
          extends SSO's original scope beyond sensors and their observations by
          including classes and properties for actuators and sampling. SOSA also
          distinguishes between phenomenonTime and resultTime.</p>

      <h2>The SSN ontology</h2>
      <p class="note">Documentation in this section has been adapted from
        something
        generated by a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/specgen/specgen">Specgen
          6</a> from
        the SSN ontology. There are known shortcomings of this presentation that
        will be improved for final form.
        In particular, annotation properties other than rdfs:comment and
        rdfs:isDefinedBy are missing throughout. dc:source annotations that
        identify the provenance of the terms are missing. rdfs:seeAlso
        annotations are also missing. If you notice any (non-annotation) axiom
        of SSN that is missing please inform the editors.</p>
      <p class="issue" data-number="62"> Here, ssn:Observation is described as a
        "situation" equivalent to the SSN-XG version of ssn. That is, a
        convenient concept that groups together all sorts of information that we
        identify as an observation. The working group made a decision to redfine
        ssn:Observation to behave as an act, action, or activity to be closer to
        the OGC O&amp;M notion of observation. This is not as straightforward as
        was anticipated and remains an issue to be resolved here.</p>

              sensor's properties are recorded directly (with
              hasMeasurementCapability, for example), but the data sheet can be
              used for example to record the manufacturers specifications versus
              observed capabilites, or if more is known than the manufacturer
              specifies, etc. The data sheet is an information object about the
              sensor's properties, rather than a direct link to the actual
              properties themselves.</span> <br>

      <h2>Alignment to SSN of the SSN-XG, ssn-ssnx</h2>
      <p class="issue" data-number="103">How should the alignment be formally
        defined here? This presentation is experimental and rough at present.</p>
      This section formally relates the SSN to the previous version of SSN that
      was published by the SSN-XG ("old SSN"). This may be useful for
      backward-compatibility and transition purposes. While the namespaces for
      SSN and DUL have changed since the SSN-XG first published old SSN, every
      class and property term of SSN here is equivalent to the corresponding
      class and property term of old SSN with the only exceptions noted here.
      <p style="text-align: center;">The namespace for SSN terms is <span class="repeated"
          style="font-family: courier;">http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">There are no terms defined in the
        alignment, so no prefix is recommended.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">The SSN alignment, known as "ssn-ssnx" is
        available at <a href="http://www.w3.org/2017/01/ssn-ssnx/">http://www.w3.org/2017/01/ssn-ssnx/</a>.</p>
      The class ssn:Sensor has been redefined from the old SSN, so the assertion
      below holds in (approximately) RDF/XML syntax.
      <pre class=""> <code>
&amp;old = "http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/ssn#"
&amp;ssn = "http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/"
&lt;owl:Class rdf:about="&amp;old;Sensor"&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&amp;ssn;Sensor"/&gt;
&lt;/owl:Class&gt;
</code>
</pre>
      All other SSN class and properties are declared to be equivalent.
      Therefore, the following pattern applies in (approximately) RDF/XML
      syntax.
      <pre class=""> <code>
&amp;old = "http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/ssn#"
&amp;ssn = "http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/"
For every owl:ObjectProperty <i>O</i> in SSN but not in {Sensor}, 
    assert the fragment:
        &lt;owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="&amp;old;<i>O</i>"&gt;
            &lt;owl:equivalentProperty rdf:resource="&amp;ssn;<i>O</i>"&gt;
        &lt;/owl:ObjectProperty&gt;
Endfor
For every owl:Class <i>C</i> in SSN but not in {Sensor}, 
    assert the fragment:
        &lt;owl:Class rdf:about="&amp;old;<i>C</i>"&gt;
            &lt;owl:equivalentClass rdf:resource="&amp;ssn;<i>C</i>"&gt;
        &lt;/owl:Class&gt;
Endfor
</code>

    <section id="OM_Alignment" class="informativve">
      <h2>Alignment to OGC Observations and Measurements</h2>
      <p>This section introduces the alignment of SOSA/SSN to OGC
          Observations and Measurements [[OandM]]. </p>
      <p>O&amp;M is specified as a UML model, following the patterns specified
        in ISO 19109 Geographic Information - Rules
          for Application Schema [[ISO-19109]]. This means that the classes represent
        concepts from the application domain, so can be approximately equated
        with classes in an ontology.</p>
      <p>Two OWL implementations of O&amp;M have been described: an explicit
        translation of the UML [[OandM]] following
        the rules specified in [[ISO-19150-2]]; and
        a handcrafted version in more idiomatic OWL [[OM-Lite]]. The advantage of the former is that it provides an RDF
        resource denoted by a URI and therefore a convenient identifier for
        every UML class, class attribute, and association-role from the original
        O&amp;M model, but at a cost of including a large set of dependencies on
        similar OWL translations of several other UML models from the ISO 19100
        series. </p>
      <p class="issue" data-number="111">Complete SOSA/SSN to O&amp;M mapping
        table should be included in the SSN document and an alignment ontology
        provided.</p>
      <!--
<p class="note">An RDF representation of a preliminary SOSA-O&amp;M alignment is at <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sdw/blob/gh-pages/ssn/rdf/sosa-om.ttl">https://github.com/w3c/sdw/blob/gh-pages/ssn/rdf/sosa-om.ttl</a> . URIs from the official ISO/TC 211 OWL implementation are used to identify the UML elements from ISO 19156/OGC O&amp;M. </p>

      <p>Modularization of SSN might work like some of the following suggestions
        under discussion</p>

        <li> Clearly separate observation, sensor, and deployment parts.
          <p class="issue" data-number="62">How do we align Observation to
            O&amp;M, does it become a prov:Activity? </p>
        </li>

          <p class="issue" data-number="71">Should sao:point and sao:segment be
            inside the core for time series analysis? </p>
          <p class="issue" data-number="88">What is the scope of the
            sosa:Platform class and how does it relate to the ssn:Platform?</p>
          <p class="issue" data-number="89">Is the sosa:Process class needed in
            the core and how is it different to ssn:Process?</p>
          <p class="issue" data-number="90">What are the implication of the new
            sosa:Result class, should that be changed in SSN too, i.e. collapse
            ssn:SensorOutput and ssn:ObservationValue into one class?</p>
          <p class="issue" data-number="91">Design for Actuation in sosa needs
            to be revisited and justified with best practices.</p>
          <p class="issue" data-number="92">Do we need Sampling in SOSA?</p>
          <p class="issue" data-number="93">What is the alignment between Sensor
            in SOSA and SSN?</p>
        </li>
        <li> Disentangling SSN from DUL may require adding things to SSN that
          were otherwise needed from DUL, for example, measured values.
          <p class="issue" data-number="51">How do we replace those components
            of dul that seem to be core to ssn if dul is not being used? </p>
        </li>
        <li> Consider O&amp;M alignment (see O&amp;Mlite). Assuming the DUL
          separation above works well, the O&amp;M alignment could be handled
          the same way. There is a known issue with incompatibility with SSN+DUL
          and O&amp;M resulting from a difference in modelling observations. </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="issue" data-number="52">What goes in SSN and what should be
        just a recommended profile/extract/extension? These could include e.g.
        WoT? Iot-lite? satellite sensors? samples? human sensors? Or do we just
        advise how to do this in general? </p>
      <p class="issue" data-number="82">Are there additional properties needed
        for ssn:observation to represent forecasts as observations.</p>
      <p class="issue" data-number="67">Given the distinction between records
        and events, ssn:Observation is not the same concept as om:Observation.
        This arises also in alignment with PROV-O</p>
      <p class="issue" data-number="53"> Align SSN with PROV-O </p>
      <p>Two such alignments have already been published in the literature [[SSN-PROV]]
        and [[OM-Lite]]. One proposal functions mostly
        rather like the alignment to DUL as described
        above in form, but some rather useful SWRL is also used.</p>
      <p class="issue" data-number="54">Is it ok to use SWRL, too, for this?
        Or would it be better to make some bigger changes to SSN to align with
        PROV-O?</p>
      <p class="issue" data-number="11">Is the provenance requirement in
        scope?</p>
      <p class="issue" data-number="55"> Align SSN with RDF datacube </p>
      This alignment is necessary, at least, for the common use case of sensored
      time-series. There are a few examples in the literature, but it is
      suggested that some structural change to core SSN is needed to make this
      work. This needs to be considered in the context of the DUL
      disentanglement above because the encoding of measured values is important
      here. Observed properties also need to be checked.
      <p class="issue" data-number="56"> SSN for IoT devices </p>
      This could be achieved by defining a small SSN module that is suitable for
      small devices; by adopting IoT-lite or some other IoT ontology with a
      well-defined relationship to SSN (ie a formalised alignment). There are
      suggestions to reduce memory by short uris and labels (and annotations?),
      too.
      <p> In this context actuation is a clear need and should be considered. </p>
      <p> The user should be able to understand the network resource cost of
        proposed instructions (for example, power required per measurement,
        current battery life, latency before instructions can be executed).
        These qualities could be interpreted by the scientist user directly, or
        by an automated agent aiming to optimize network efficiency through
        resource scheduling and optimisation algorithms. </p>
      <p class="issue" data-number="57"> Align SSN with the ontology developed
        for the coverage deliverable </p>
      We would like to show that the sensors that observe coverage (commonly
      satellite, but could be in-situ ground-based sensors) can be described
      using SSN while their observations can be described via the SDW coverage
      deliverable.
      <p class="issue" data-number="58"> Extend SSN to cover requirements
        identified in our UCR</p>
      These should be done by optional extensions to SSN, in the style of the
      optional DUL alignment above, so as to minimally impact existing users and
      to avoid overcrowding of the core. The requirements are recorded in the <a
        href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#arSSN">UCR document</a>.
      <p class="issue" data-number="42"> Align SSN to implement Best
        Practices as defined in our BP deliverable.</p>
      In particular, the modelling of time and space should concur. SSN should
      tighten its modelling of location. There are relevant UCR requirements for
      this.
      <p class="issue" data-number="59"> Extend SSN to to cover requirements
        identified in our wish List. These requirements have not been discussed
        in the group and are subject to prioritisation and resources.</p>

      <h2>Change history</h2>
      Changes since the original (linked here) include
      <ol>
        <li> The Dolce Ultra Lite ontology, that was imported in to ssn, is no
          longer imported and all axioms using terms from DUL have been removed
          from SSN and collected in the DUL-SSN alignment ontology.
        </li>
        <li> The namespace was changed to match the planned namespace for this
          publication.
        </li>
        <li> The modularization as presented here, including the core, is
          entirely new.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Changes since the FPWD
        (http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-vocab-ssn-20160531/) include...</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Correction to include some ssn terms that were unintentionally
          dropped from the FPWD. Correction to remove an asserted subclass of
          owl:Thing that was introduced into FPWD (these were both by-products
          of Dolce removal).
        </li>
        <li> Correction to some https namespace usage that crept into the FPWD </li>
        <li> Transition to the new namespace used by the DUL ontology</li>
        <li> Inclusion of the DUL alignment and the old SSN (of the SSN-XG)
          alignment. </li>
        <li> ssn:Sensor has been changed to be a subclass of dul:Object instead

        <li> Various typography and spelling errors and consistency of
          expression in annotation properties have been improved. These do not
          induce any changes in the intended meaning of the terms. </li>
        <li> Specgen 6 has been used to generate the ontology documentation. The
          popular sketch of SSN structure has been removed. </li>

          <p class="issue" data-number="105"> Object properties ssn:isValueOf,
            ssn:produces and ssn:featureinObservation, along with a
            propertychain subproperty of produces and another propertychain
            subproperty of hasProperty, were introduced unintentionally in the
            FPWD. These have been removed here but could be reinstated if there
            is demand.
