      <p>The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology is an ontology for describing
sensors and their observations, the involved procedures,  the studied features of
interest, the samples used to do so, and the observed properties, as well as actuators.
SSN follows a horizontal and vertical modularization architecture by including a
lightweight but self-contained core ontology called SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and
Actuator) for its elementary classes and properties. With their different scope and different degrees of axiomatization, SSN and SOSA are able to support a wide range of applications and use
cases, including satellite imagery, large-scale scientific monitoring, industrial and
household infrastructures, social sensing, citizen science, observation-driven ontology
engineering, and the Web of Things. Both ontologies are described below, and examples of
their usage are given.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Sensors are a major source of data available on the Web
        today. While sensor data may be published as mere values, searching, reusing, integrating, and interpreting these data requires more than just the observation results. Of equal
        importance for the proper interpretation of these values is information
        about the studied feature of interest, such as a river, the observed
        property, such as flow velocity, the utilized sampling strategy, such as
        the specific locations and times at which the velocity was measured, and
        a variety of other information. OGC's Sensor Web Enablement standards
        [[OandM]], [[SensorML]] provide a means to annotate sensors and their
        observations. However, these standards are not integrated and
        aligned with W3C Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data in
        particular, which are key drivers for creating and maintaining a global
        and densely interconnected graph of data. With the rise of the Web of
        Things and smart cities and homes more generally, actuators and the data
        they produce also become first-class citizens of the Web. Given their
        close relation to sensors, observations, procedures, and features of
        interest, it is desirable to provide a common ontology that also
        includes actuators and actuation. Finally, with the increasing diversity
        of data and data providers, definitions such as those for sensors need
        to be broadened, e.g., to include social sensing. The following
        specifications introduce the new Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) and
        Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) ontologies that are set
        out to provide flexible but coherent perspectives for representing the
        entities, relations, and activities involved in sensing, sampling, and
        actuation. SOSA provides a lightweight core for SSN and aims at broadening 
  the target audience and application areas that can make use of Semantic Web ontologies.
  At the same time, SOSA acts as minimal interoperability fall-back level, i.e., 
  it defines those common classes and properties for which data can be safely
        exchanged across all uses of SSN, its modules, and SOSA.</p>

    <section id="Modularization" class="informative">
      <h2>Modularization</h2>
      <p><span data-dobid="hdw">Practitioners</span> using the original Semantic
        Sensor Network Ontology as defined in the <em>W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group </em> [[SSNO]] have identified a major
        issue in its complexity, partly due to the layering underneath the
        Dolce-UltraLite (DUL) upper level ontology. In response to this, the new
        Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology offers several ontology subsets that
        are distinguished mainly through their ontological commitments. This
        section explains the rationale and method for modularizing SSN, i.e.,
        offering several distinct ontologies that are similar in their domain of
        discourse, but with different ontological commitments, suitable to
        several use cases and target audiences. For example, SOSA is intended 
  to provide Schema.org-style semantic enrichment capabilities for 
  data repositories managed by an audience broader than typical ontology engineers, 
   while still ensuring interoperability with SSN-based repositories.</p>
      <p>Ontology modularization is a common method used in ontology engineering
        to segment an ontology into smaller parts. In general, ontology
        modularization aims at providing users of ontologies with the knowledge
        they require, reducing the scope as much as possible to what is strictly
        necessary in a given use case. Two main categories of ontology
        modularization can be distinguished.</p>
      <p>The first category comprises those approaches that focus on the
        composition of existing ontologies by means of integrating and mapping
        ontologies, most commonly through <code>owl:import</code> statements.
        OWL import has a direction from a dependent ontology to a dependency
        ontology. Although import is transitive, knowledge is propagated in only
        one direction. The importing ontology assumes all the meaning of the
        imported terms used, by including all axioms relevant to the meaning of
        these terms. However, the imported ontology does not capture any of the
        semantics of the importing ontology.</p>
      <p>The second category comprises of mapping approaches that aim to
        partition and extract parts of ontologies as modules. These mapping
        approaches are not necessarily directional, but most approaches of
        ontology extraction rely on the directionality of the imported modules.
        The main feature of an ontology module under the second category is that
        it is self-contained, i.e., the module captures the meaning of the
        imported terms used by including all axioms relevant to the meaning of
        these terms. This means, that the result of certain reasoning tasks such
        as subsumption or query answering within a single module should be
        possible and result in the same answers without the need to access other
        modules of the ontology.</p>
      <p> Our modularization uses the first approach by composing the
        ontology into several modules that use <code>owl:import</code>
        statements, whereby we distinguish two methods depending on the
        directionality of the segmentation: a vertical segmentation and a
        horizontal segmentation.</p>
      <figure>
        <img alt="Ontology Modules" src="images/modular_ontology.png">
        <figcaption>The SOSA and SSN ontologies and their vertical and horizontal modules.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3 id="vertical-segmentation">Vertical Segmentation</h3>
      <p>Vertical modules build upon each other, i.e., they directionally <code>owl:import</code>
        lower level modules. Lower level modules are independent of their higher
        level modules and logically consistent on their own.</p>
      <p>For example, the <i>Dolce-UltraLite Alignment Module</i> imports the <i>SSN
          Ontology</i> which itself imports the <i>SOSA Ontology</i>. However,
        in reverse, neither <i>SOSA</i> nor <i>SSN</i> import the <i>Dolce-UltraLite
          Alignment Module</i>. In fact, <i>SOSA</i> as the core, does not
        import any other ontologies, which makes it truly independent of
        vertical modules that add more expressivity and further ontological
        commitments to the lightweight semantics of <i>SOSA</i>.</p>
      <p>Note that higher level here is not to be confused with upper level
        ontologies. Upper level ontologies are general knowledge ontologies that
        can be directionally imported in many domains, whereas our definition of
        higher level ontologies here refers to an ontology that extends one or
        several ontology modules to capture a larger part of a knowledge domain
        and/or combine knowledge domains.</p>
      <h3 id="horizontal-segmentation">Horizontal Segmentation</h3>
      <p>Modules that are horizontally layered may depend on each other, i.e.,
        they may rely on the directional import of another horizontal module.
        Only one horizontal module that is dependent on the SSN ontology is
        presented in this specification, the <i>Sample Relations Module</i>.
        Other ontologies that add domain-specific terms to SSN, but require the
        import of SSN, can be considered horizontal modules.</p>

       <section id="Developments" class="informative">
      <h2>Origins of SSN and SOSA</h2>
      <p>Here we briefly review the origins of SSN and SOSA, namely the initial
        SSN version published by the <em>W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator
          Group </em> [[SSNO]] and work on Sensor Web Enablement by the OGC. We
        also highlight the most substantial changes made since the initial
        release of the SSN ontology.</p>
      <p>Starting in 2002, the OGC's Sensor Web Enablement initiative has developed
        a generic framework for delivering sensor data, dealing with
        remote-sensing, moving platforms, and in-situ monitoring and sensing.
        The Sensor Observation Service defines a standard query interface for
        sensor and observation data, following the pattern established by OGC
        for their Web Services. The returned XML data conforms with the Sensor Model
        Language [[SensorML]] and OMXML [[OMXML]], whereby the latter implements
        Observations and Measurements [[OandM]]. </p>
      <p>SensorML and O&amp;M are complementary viewpoints. SensorML
        is 'provider-centric' and encodes details of the sensor along with raw
        observation data. SensorML is self-contained and highly flexible. This
        makes life easy for data producers but is demanding on consumers. 
        SensorML provides extensive support for serialization of numeric data arrays
        and is particularly optimized for data that includes multiple parallel
        streams that must be processed together. For example, the data collected
        by cameras on airborne vehicles must be geo-referenced based on the
        instantaneous position of the platform and orientation of the camera. In
        contrast, O&amp;M was designed to be more 'user-centric' with the target
        of the observation and the observed property as first-class objects.
        O&amp;M works at a higher semantic level than SensorML, but only
        provides abstract classes for sensors, features of interest and
        observable properties, expecting the details to be provided by specific
        applications and domains. O&amp;M also provided a model for sampling,
        since almost all scientific observations are made on a subset of, or
        proxy for, the ultimate feature of interest. </p>
         <p>The initial <em>W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group </em>ontology
          (SSN) was built around an ontology design pattern called the <em>Stimulus
            Sensor Observation</em> (SSO) pattern [[SSO-Pattern]]. The SSO was
          developed as a minimal and common ground for heavy-weight ontologies
          for the use on the Semantic Sensor Web as well as to explicitly
          address the need for light-weight semantics requested by the Linked
          Data community. The SSO was also aligned to the <em>Dolce-Ultralite </em>upper
          ontology (DUL). </p>
        <p>The new SSN described in this document is based on a revised and
          expanded version of this pattern, namely the <em>Sensor, Observation,
            Sample, and Actuator</em> (SOSA) ontology. Similar to the original
          SSO, SOSA acts as a central building block for the SSN but puts more
          emphasis on light-weight use and the ability to be used standalone.
          The axiomatization also changed to provide an experience more related
          to Schema.org. Notable differences include the usage of the Schema.org
          <code>domainIncludes</code> and <code>rangeIncludes</code> annotation
          properties that provide an informal semantics compared to the
          inferential semantics of their OWL 2 counterparts. In line with the
          changes implemented for the new SSN, SOSA also drops the direct DUL
          alignment although an optional alignment can be achieved via the
          SSN-DUL alignment provided in <a href="#DUL_Alignment">Section 6.1</a>. SOSA is also more explicit than SSO in its support for virtual and human sensor. Finally,
          and most notably, SOSA extends SSO's original scope beyond sensors and
          their observations by including classes and properties for actuators
          and sampling. SOSA also distinguishes between <code>phenomenonTime</code> and
          <code>resultTime</code>.</p>
 <p>Drawing on considerable implementation and application experience with SSN and sensor and observation ontologies more broadly, the new SSN and SOSA ontologies presented here are set out to address changes in scope and audience, shortcomings of the initial work, as well as new technical developments. The list below highlights the most important (but by far not exclusive) updates.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Addressing changes in scope and audience</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>The initial SSN was developed with ontology engineers in mind as the primary audience. Due to the widespread adoption of SSN, the increasing role of citizen science, the strong focus on lightweight vocabularies by the Linked Data community, and vocabularies such as Schema.org, the ontology was streamlined. SOSA is added as a core, and is also useful as a standalone ontology targeting Web developers, citizen science, lightweight Linked Data publishing, resource-constraint IoT devices, data intensive applications (with the possibility of using lightweight reasoning), and so on. The new SSN introduces additional classes and relations on top of SOSA to model the capabilities of sensors and actuators, the compositionality of systems, and so forth to suit more complex needs or cases in which more provenance data is required, e.g., to improve reproducibility.  </li>
        <li>Almost all scientific observations make heavy use of sampling strategies, and, therefore, the Sampling, Sampler, and Sample classes, as well as their corresponding properties, have been added to SOSA and SSN.</li>
        <li>Due to the increasing importance of the Web of Things and smart instrumentation and environments more  generally, the classes Actuator and Actuation have been added to SOSA and SSN.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Addressing shortcomings of the initial SSN</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>The new SSN streamlines the relations (and need for) the old Device, Platform, and Systems classes.</li>
    <li>The old SSN was perceived as too heavyweight (on its axiomatization) and too dependent on OWL reasoning by some users. To strike a balance, DL expressivity of the new lightweight SOSA ontology is ALI(D) which is efficiently supported by modern triple stores, while the new SSN is ALRIN(D). In contrast, the old SSN is SRIQ.</li>
    <li>The SSN previously imported DUL and many SSN terms inherited from DUL terms. Due to frequent user requests, this has been redesigned so that SSN (and SOSA) can be used entirely independently of DUL if desired. Some of the alignments with DUL have been reconsidered. Those parts of SSN that use DUL terms have been separated into the <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/dul">SSN Alignment with DUL ontology.</a> This alignment and therefore the role of DUL in SSN have been declared non-normative.</li>
    <li>The definitions for many classes and properties have changed slightly to improve explanation or to correct minor errors. Examples have been separated from the main definitions.</li>
    <li>The initial SSN has been criticized for its partially inconsistent handling of virtual sensors (including software and simulations) and related classes and properties. The new SSN and SOSA address this issue by allowing all major classes to be virtual, and to better support humans and other animals as agents.</li>
    <li>The notion of Procedure (formerly Plan) has been clarified to describe a workflow, protocol, plan, algorithm, or computational method specifying how to make an Observation, create a Sample, or make a change to the state of the world via an Actuator.</li>
    <li>The Observation class in the initial SSN was conceptualized as a subclass of the DUL Situation class. To improve alignment with O&amp;M and user expectations, as well as to follow a consistent modeling strategy for observations, sampling, and actuation, the Observation class defined in SOSA and the new SSN are now conceptualized as activities. </li>
    </ul>
<li><strong>Addressing technical developments</strong>
<ul>
<li>The initial SSN used local/guarded domain and range restrictions. The lightweight SOSA ontology uses an even more restrained axiomatization to foster wide reuse and adaptation among an audience that is not necessarily familiar with OWL. SOSA makes use of the <code>domainIncludes</code> and <code>rangeIncludes</code> annotation properties defined in Schema.org. These had not been available before.</li>
<li>Given the increased interest in using Semantic Web technologies directly on the level of individual sensors, actuators, or platforms, SOSA's axiomatization does not use many of the more complex language elements introduced by SSN.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

They are used in situations where observations cannot be made directly on the ultimate feature of interest, either because the entire feature cannot be observed, or because it is more convenient to use a proxy. Samples are thus artifacts of an observational strategy, and usually have no significant function outside of their role in the observation process. The characteristics of the samples themselves are generally of little interest, except to the manager of a sampling campaign, or sample curator.
                    <br/>
                    A Sample is intended to sample some FeatureOfInterest, so there is an expectation of at least one isSampleOf property.

        <h3>Sample Relations Module</h3>
        <p>Samples are often related to other samples, by sub-sampling,
          topological relationships (stations along a traverse, pixels within an
          image, probe spots on a polished section, specimens retrieved within a
          borehole) or as parts of sample processing chains (crushing,
          splitting, dissecting, disolving). There are an essentially unlimited
          set of relationships between samples, so the nature of the
          relationship has its own class. This section describes a flexible
          model to describe such relationships between samples. The model is
          based on the <a href="http://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/qualified-relation.html">QualifiedRelation
            pattern</a>. </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">The namespace for Sample relationships
          terms is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/sampling/</span>
        </p>
        <p>The suggested prefix for the sample relationships namespace is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">sampling</span></p>

        <h3>O&amp;M Alignment Module</h3>
        <p>This section introduces the alignment of SOSA/SSN to OGC Observations
          and Measurements [[OandM]] (also known as ISO 19156:2011).</p>
        <p>The XML implementation of O&amp;M [[OMXML]] is used for the payload
          for Sensor Observation Services, of which there are many operational deployments.
          Integration of these with observation data formalized using SOSA and
          SSN is highly desirable, and would be expected to significantly enrich
          the set of resources represented using SOSA/SSN. The alignment
          presented here provides a basis for transforming OM-XML data into RDF resources or OWL individuals according to the SOSA/SSN ontologies. </p>

          <h3>Identifying the UML elements</h3>
          <p>O&amp;M is specified as a UML model, following the patterns
            specified in ISO 19109 Geographic Information - Rules for
            Application Schema [[ISO-19109]]. This means that the classes
            represent concepts from the application domain, so can be
            approximately equated with classes in an ontology. </p>
          <p>An OWL implementation of O&amp;M may be generated by explicit
            translation of the UML following rules specified in [[ISO-19150-2]] -
            see [[OM-Heavy]]. This translation generates an RDF entity denoted by
            a URI for every class, class attribute, and association-role from
            the original O&amp;M UML model. The form of the URIs is also
            specified in [[ISO-19150-2]], and appear explicitly in the <a href="https://github.com/ISO-TC211/GOM/tree/master/isotc211_GOM_harmonizedOntology/19156/2011">official
              OWL implementation of ISO 19156 (O&amp;M) maintained by the ISO/TC
              211 Group on Ontology Management</a>. These URIs are therefore
            convenient identifiers for elements of the O&amp;M in a formal
            alignment. </p>
          <p>The explicit translation from the UML model comes at the cost of a large
            set of dependencies on similar OWL translations of other UML models
            from the ISO 19100 series standards. Furthermore, the ontology structure
            reflects artefacts of the UML-style of modeling. This implementation
            <i>may</i> introduce entailments that are inconsistent with SOSA/SSN
            (though no inconsistencies have been identified yet) so it is
            important to understand that use of these URIs here are principally
            intended to denote the original UML classes and properties, rather
            than this OWL implementation.</p>
          <p>NOTE: In response to the complexity of the explicit translation, a
            handcrafted version in more idiomatic OWL, without the dependencies,
            is also available [[OM-Lite]]. </p>
          <p>NOTE: At time of writing, the ISO-specified URIs do not
            de-reference. However, ISO/TC 211 are currently developing a
            publication system to enable this and thus the use of these URIs as
            Linked Data. </p>

      <h3>PROV Alignment Module</h3>
      <p>This section introduces the alignment of SOSA to W3C PROV ([[prov-overview]], [[prov-dm]], [[prov-o]]).</p>
      <p>The underlying structure of PROV is based around a process-flow model, with three base classes: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Entity">Entity</a>, which is the class of physical, digital, conceptual, or other kinds of things with some fixed aspects; <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Activity">Activity</a>, which is the class of things that occur over a period of time and act upon or with entities, and it may include consuming, processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities; and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Agent">Agent</a>, the class of things that bear some form of responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity, or for another agent's activity.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>The SOSA/SSN ontologies conceive observations, actuations, and acts of sampling as activities or events, that results in information being produced, or a change in the world, or the production or transformation of a sample. 
      Thus, an alignment of SOSA to PROV is natural. 
      Compton et al. [[SSN-PROV]] and Cox [[OM-Lite]] have previously described alignments of the SSNX and O&amp;M models with [[prov-o]].
      The alignment here is based on that work, also extended to consider actuation. </p>

        <h2>Common Modeling Questions</h2>
    This section informally discusses how to handle common modeling questions such as locations, forecasts, and quantity values with a unit of measure.
    
    <section id="location">
      <h3>Location</h3>
      <p>Many of the key classes provided by SOSA and SSN represent entities that can be located in space 
      such as sensors, features of interest, actuators, samples, and so forth, or activities that can be 
      located via their participating entities, e.g., platforms. These entities will usually be described using 
      models and ontologies defined for application domains, including technical disciplines, social and business 
      contexts. In these contexts there are a number of implementations that support the expression of spatial 
      properties, including location. These are discussed further in the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices 
      note [[SDW-BP]]. </p>
      <p>In particular, GeoSPARQL [[GeoSPARQL]] provides a flexible and relatively complete platform for geospatial objects, that fosters interoperability 
      between geo-datasets. To do so, these entities can be declared as instances of geo:Feature and geometries can be 
      assigned to them via the geo:hasGeometry property.  In case of classes, e.g., specific features of 
      interests such as rivers, these can be defined as subclasses of geo:Feature.</p>
     </section>
        
     <section id="forecasts" class="informative">
     <h3>Forecasts</h3>
        <p>One may also represent forecasts as observations if the value of <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code>
        is later in time than the <code>sosa:resultTime</code>. Given the
        definition of these terms, it means that: <em>The time when the
          Observation act was completed is before the time that the Result of
          the observation applies to the FeatureOfInterest.</em></p>
        <p class="note"> Other means to represent forecasts are reported, but
          not in the scope of this specification. For example
          [[Lefrancois-et-al-2017]] derives the SSN <code>Sensing/Sensor/Observation</code>
          pattern and define <code>Forecasting/Forecaster/Forecast</code>
          classes.</p>
        <p class="note">Describing a plan for some actuation or observation in
          the future is not covered by this specification.</p>
     </section>

     <section id="quantity-values-and-unit-of-measures" class="informative">
     <h3>Quantity Values and Unit of Measures</h3>
        <p>The result of an <a href="#SOSAObservation"><code>sosa:Observation</code></a> or an <a href="#SOSAActuation"><code>sosa:Actuation</code></a> can be a quantity value with a numeric value and a unit of measure.

        <p class="note">It is not in the scope of this specification to recommend any particular way of modeling results as quantity values. 
        There exists external vocabularies that are specifically designed for modeling quantity values as OWL individuals. Examples 
        include the Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies (QUDT, [[QUDT]]) and the Ontology of Units of Measure (OM, [[Rijgersberg-et-al-2013]]). <br/>
        With QUDT 1.1, a <a href="#SOSAResult"><code>sosa:Result</code></a> would be a <a href="http://qudt.org/"><code>qudt:QuantityValue</code></a>.<br/>
        With OM 2, a <a href="#SOSAResult"><code>sosa:Result</code></a> would be a <a href="http://www.wurvoc.org/vocabularies/"><code>om:Measure</code> or <code>om:Point</code></a>.</p>

       <p class="note"> Other means to represent quantity values as literals are reported, but
          not in the scope of this specification. This solution would require the use of some custom datatype 
          whose value space is some set of quantity values. Such a datatype should be supported 
          by RDF and SPARQL engines to support the comparison of quantity values. 
          On the other hand, this approach is not compatible with the OWL specifications, that 
          restrict the set of datatypes that can be used. See sec. 5.2 in [[owl2-syntax]] for more details.</p>

     <h3>Generic or Specific Instances of ssn:Property</h3>
        <p>This specification does not specify whether an instance of <a href="#SSNProperty"><code>ssn:Property</code></a> should be generic to all features of interest (e.g., <code>ex:Temperature</code>,
         <code>ex:OnOffStatus</code>), or specific to a single feature of interest (e.g., <code>&lt;myBodyTemperature&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;LightStatus&gt;</code>).
         Implementers are free to choose one way of modeling things or the other.
         </p>
         <p>On the other hand, one SHOULD NOT use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/#F12:_Punning">OWL punning</a> to make <code>ex:Temperature</code> denote both a subclass of 
         <a href="#SSNProperty"><code>ssn:Property</code></a> and an instance of <a href="#SSNProperty"><code>ssn:Property</code></a>. In fact, merging the 
         two examples below in a single RDF Graph would make an OWL reasoner infer that <code>ex:Temperature</code>, <code>&lt;office/1/temperature&gt;</code>, and
         <code>&lt;office/2/temperature&gt;</code>, denote the same individual.</p>
         <p>This also holds for subclasses of <a href="#SSNProperty"><code>ssn:Property</code></a>: <a href="#SOSAObservableProperty"><code>sosa:ObservableProperty</code></a>, and <a href="#SOSAActuatableProperty"><code>sosa:ActuatableProperty</code></a>.</p>
         <p>This first example is modeling instances of <a href="#SSNProperty"><code>ssn:Property</code></a> as generic to all features of interest:</p>

            <p>In order to characterize a thing with a large extent, or which is not directly accessible, the usual observational strategy is to obtain one or more samples. Observations may then be made more conveniently on the samples, with the intention of characterizing the larger thing. This intentionality is captured using the property <code>sosa:isSampleOf</code>. </p>
            <p>In the following example, the ice core is a sample of the Antarctic ice sheet, and observations are made on the ice core. </p>
            <p>A convenient side effect of this feature is that all observations related to the larger thing (the ice sheet) can be found, and then potentially joined together in a meta-analysis in order to characterize that. </p>

          <h3>Examples from O&amp;M</h3>
          <p>An XML implementation of the Observations and Measurements specification is available from OGC [[OandM]], known as [[OMXML]]. Annex C in that document contains a large set of examples. To assist users of O&amp;M to understand SOSA/SSN, and potentially to migrate services based on OMXML to SOSA/SSN, an RDF file containing a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sdw/blob/gh-pages/ssn/integrated/examples/om-20.ttl">graph corresponding to the OMXML examples is provided</a>. </p>
          <p>Note that in some cases the information contained in the OMXML examples goes beyond what is supported directly by SOSA/SSN, so the examples use terms from some other well known RDF vocabularies, such as [[GeoSPARQL]], [[QUDT]], [[owl-time]], and [[prov-o]], as well as the <a href="#Sample_Relations">sample relations</a> module. In some cases these only approximate the semantics of the OMXML examples. This is indicated in editorial notes embedded in the RDF file. In a few places where there was no well-known RDF implementation matching the requirements, the details have been omitted. </p>

          <li>The DUL ontology, that was imported in SSN, is no
            longer imported and all axioms using terms from DUL have been
            removed from SSN and collected in the DUL-SSN alignment module. </li>
          <li>The namespace was changed to match the planned namespace for this
            publication. </li>
          <li>The modularization as presented here, including the core, is
            entirely new. </li>

        <ol>
          <li>Correction to include some SSN terms that were unintentionally
            dropped from the FPWD. Correction to remove an asserted subclass of
            owl:Thing that was introduced into FPWD (these were both by-products
            of the DUL removal). </li>
          <li>Correction to some https namespace usage that crept into the FPWD.</li>
          <li>Transition to the new namespace used by the DUL module.</li>
          <li>Inclusion of the DUL alignment and the old SSN (of the SSN-XG)
            alignment. </li>
          <li> ssn:Sensor has been changed to be a subclass of dul:Object
            instead of dul:Physical Object.</li>
          <li>Various typography and spelling errors and consistency of
            expression in annotation properties have been improved. These do not
            induce any changes in the intended meaning of the terms. </li>
          <li>Specgen 6 has been used to generate the ontology documentation.
            The popular sketch of SSN structure has been removed. </li>
          <li>Object properties ssn:isValueOf, ssn:produces and
            ssn:featureInObservation, along with a propertychain subproperty of
            produces and another propertychain subproperty of hasProperty, were
