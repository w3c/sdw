      <p>The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as "SSN" or sometimes "SSNO") is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the observations they make of the physical world.  SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of "just enough" ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.</p>
	  <p style="text-align: center;">The namespace for SSN terms is <span class="repeated" style="font-family: courier;">https://www.w3.org/ns/ssn</span> 
	  <p style="text-align: center;"> The SSN ontology itself is available <a  href="https://www.w3.org/ns/ssn">here.</a></p>
    </section>
    <section  id="sotd">
      <p>This is the first published version of the SSN since its original publication by the SSN-XG, the Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group of the W3C. This is a very incomplete draft to indicate the scope and style of changes proposed to be made to the original SSN. This document is both incomplete and inconsistent, but is being published at this stage to solicit comment from the community of SSN users and would-be users.</p>
      <p><strong>For OGC</strong> This is a Public Draft of a document prepared
        by the Spatial Data on the Web Working Group (<a  href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">SDWWG</a>)
        — a joint W3C-OGC project (see <a  href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter">charter</a>).

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p> Sensor observations are a major source of data published on the Web.
        Yet, publishing, searching, reusing, and integrating this data requires
        more than just the observation values. Of equal importance is
        information about the studied feature of interest, such as a river, the
        observed property, such as flow velocity,and the sampling strategy. The 
        sampling location, instrumentation, and information about
        the deployment of the instruments on a sensor platform may also be required for propoer interpretation. OGC's Sensor
        Web Enablement standards provide a means to annotate sensors and their
        observations. However, these standards are not yet integrated and
        aligned with paradigms such as Linked Data and W3C Semantic Web
        technologies more generally, that are believed to be a key driver for
        creating and maintaining a global and densely interconnected graph of
        data. The W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group (SSN) addressed
        these issues by developing an ontology that spans over multiple OGC
        standards and other specifications to support the semantic lifting of
        observations together with data about the sensors and their
        capabilities, deployment information, and so forth. Based on this
        initial work, the following document specifies a revised, modularized,
        and extended version of the SSN.</p>

	<li> <p>The The DOLCE ultralite ontology (DUL)  was previously imported into SSN and many SSN terms inherited from DUL terms.

	<li> Class Sensor has been moved up to become a direct subclass of dul:Object instead of  dul:PhysicalObject. This is not expected to affect existing uses of SSN due to dul:Object being a direct parent of DUL:PhysicalObject.

	<p class="issue" data-number="">The movement of Sensor to become a direct subclass of dul:Object has been discussed but postponed by the Working Group</p>

    <section  id="Modularisation"  class="informative">
      <h2>Modularisation</h2>
      <p> </p>
      <p>One of the major issues <span  data-dobid="hdw">practitioner</span>s
        raised with the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology as defined in the XG is
        its complexity, partly due to the layering underneath the DOLCE
        UltraLite Upperlevel ontology. This section explains the rationale and
        method for modularisation of the SSN.</p>
		
      <p>Ontology modularisation is a common method investigated in ontology
        engineering to segment an ontology into smaller parts. In general,
        ontology modularization aims at providing users of ontologies with the
        knowledge they require, reducing the scope as much as possible to what
        is strictly necessary in a given use case. Two main categories of
        ontology modularization can be distinguished.</p>
      <p>The first category comprises of approaches that focus on the
        composition of existing ontologies by means of integrating and mapping
        ontologies, most commonly through <code>owl:import</code>
        statements. OWL import has a direction from a source ontology to a
        target ontology, and although it is transitive, it only supports
        knowledge propagation in one direction, i.e. the importing ontology
        captures all the meaning of the imported terms used, i.e., it includes
        all axioms relevant to the meaning of these terms, however, the imported
        ontology may not capture any of the semantics of the importing ontology.</p>
      <p>The second category comprises of mapping approaches that aim to
        partition and extract parts of ontologies as modules. These mapping
        approaches are not necessarily directional, but most approaches of
        ontology extraction rely on directionality of the imported modules. In
        fact in [Cuenca Grau et al 2009] it has been proven that in OWL DL,
        which is a syntactical variant of the Description Logic SHOIN, checking
        whether an ontology is in fact a module of an ontology given a
        vocabulary is an undecidable problem. However, the main feature of an
        ontology module under the second category is that it is self-contained,
        i.e., the module captures the meaning of the imported terms used by
        including all axioms relevant to the meaning of these terms. This means,
        that the result of certain reasoning tasks such as subsumption or query
        answering within a single module should be possible and result in the
        same answers without the need to access other modules of the ontology.</p>
      <p> In order to ensure this property, a solution has to be found for
        concepts in the ontology module that inherit object properties from
        concepts that are not in the module. One solution proposed by [Cuenca
        Grau et al] is to include the bottom concept for all such missing
        concepts. Another solution is to change the domain and range of an
        object property. Our modularisation approach uses two different methods
        depending on the directionality of the segmentation.</p>
      <img  alt="Ontology Modules"  src="images/modular_ontology.png">
      <p>Figure 1 gives an overview of the modules of the SSN ontology. The
        layering of the rings represents two methods of segmentation we
        distinguish, horizontal and vertical segmentation, as follows:<br>
      </p>
      <h3> Vertical Segmentation</h3>
      <p>Vertical modules are build upon each other, i.e. they directionally
        owl:import lower level modules. If a higher level module is used without
        importing its lower levels it may lead to inconsistencies or at least it
        will lead to different answers when reasoning over the module compared
        to reasoning over its complete stack of vertical ontology modules.
        However, lower level modules are independent of their higher level
        modules and logically consistent. Note that higher level here is not to
        be confused with upper level ontologies. Upper level ontologies are
        general knowledge ontologies that can be directionally imported in many
        domains, whereas our definition of higher level ontologies here refers
        to an ontology that extends one or several ontology modules to capture a
        larger part of a knowledge domain and/or combine knowledge domains.<br>
      </p>
      <h3> Horizontal Segmentation</h3>
      <p>Modules that are horizontally layered do not depend on each other, i.e.
        they do not rely on the import of another horizontal module to lead to
        the same answers when reasoning over the module itself as opposed to
        reasoning over an imported horizontal module. If a concept in a module
        is connected to a concept in another horizontally layered module through
        a directional property such as a subClassOf relation or any asymmetric
        property, the range concept of such a relation has to be included in the
        module using the URI of the concept as it is defined in the other
        module.</p>
		
		<p  class="issue"  data-number=""> This presentation on modularisation is incomplete. For example, we may have that the SSN core is an RDFS-only vocabulary with modular extensions supporting both expanded terms and expanded expressiveness in the ontology language.</p>

      <h2>Work Plan</h2>
      <p>This section identifies work that is planned to be done in the next
        iteration of the document. Comment on these topics and their priority is
        invited. </p>
      <p  class="issue"  data-number="">Check and reconsider or redesign
        modularisation of SSN. See proposal in charter: noting the work to split
        the ontology into smaller sections to offer simplified access </p>
      <p>Modularisation of SSN might work like some of the following suggestions
      under discussion</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Clearly separate observation, sensor, and deployment parts. </li>
        <li> Disentangling SSN from DUL may require adding things to SSN
          that were otherwise  needed from DUL, for example, measured values.
  
          <p  class="issue"  data-number="">How do we replace those components
            of dul that seem to be core to ssn if dul is not being used? </p>
        </li>
        <li> Consider O&amp;M alignment (see O&amp;Mlite). Assuming the DUL
          separation above works well, the O&amp;M alignment could be handled
          the same way. There is a known issue with incompatibility with SSN+DUL
          and O&amp;M resulting from a difference in modelling observations. </li>
</ol>
          <p class="issue">What goes in SSN and what should be
            just a recommended profile/extract/extension? These could include
            e.g. WoT? Iot-lite? satelite sensors? samples? human sensors? Or do
            we just advise how to do this in general? </p>
          <p class="issue">Given the distinction between
            records and events, ssn:Observation is not the same concept as
            om:Observation. This arises also in alignment with PROV-O</p>


      <p  class="issue"  data-number=""> Align SSN with PROV-O </p>
      Two such alignments have already been published in the literature. One
      proposal functions mostly rather like the alignment to DUL as described
      above in form, but some rather useful SWRL is also used.</p>
	 
      <p  class="issue"  data-number="">Is it ok to use SWRL, too, for this? Or
        would it be better to make some bigger changes to SSN to align with
        PROV-O?</p>
	
      <p  class="issue"  data-number="">We have an outstanding <a  href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/track/issues/11">
          issue-11: Is the provenance requirement in scope?</a></p>
		   
      <p  class="issue"  data-number=""> Align SSN with RDF datacube </p>
      This alignment is necessary, at least, for the common use case of sensored
      time-series. There are a few examples in the literature, but it is
      suggested that some structural change to core SSN is needed to make this
      work. This needs to be considered in the context of the DUL
      disentanglement above because the encoding of measured values is important
      here. Observed properties also need to be checked.
	  
      <p  class="issue"  data-number=""> SSN for IoT devices </p>
      This could be achieved by defining a small SSN module that is suitable for
      small devices; by adopting IoT-lite or some other IoT ontology with a
      well-defined relationship to SSN (ie a formalised alignment). There are
      suggestions to reduce memory by short uris and labels (and annotations?),
      too.
      <p> In this context actuation is a clear need and should be considered. </p>
      <p> The user should be able to understand the network resource cost of
        proposed instructions (for example, power required per measurement,
        current battery life, latency before instructions can be executed).
        These qualities could be interpreted by the scientist user directly, or
        by an automated agent aiming to optimise network efficiency through
        resource scheduling and optimisation algorithms. </p>
      <p  class="issue"  data-number=""> Align SSN with the ontology developed
        for the coverage deliverable </p>
      We would like to show that the sensors that observe coverage (commonly
      satellite, but could be in-situ ground-based sensors) can be described
      using SSN while their observations can be described via the SDW coverage
      deliverable.
      <p  class="issue"  data-number=""> Extend SSN to to cover requirements
        identified in our UCR</p>
      These should be done by optional extensions to SSN, in the style of the
      optional DUL alignment above, so as to minimally impact existing users and
      to avoid overcrowding of the core. The requirements are recorded in the <a
         href="http://w3c.github.io/sdw/UseCases/SDWUseCasesAndRequirements.html#arSSN">
        UCR document </a>
      <p  class="issue"  data-number=""> Align SSN to to implement Best
        Practices as defined in our BP deliverable.</p>
      In particular, the modelling of time and space should concur. SSN should
      tighten its modelling of location. There are relevant UCR requirements for
      this.
      <p  class="issue"  data-number=""> Extend SSN to to cover requirements
        identified in our wish List</p>
      See the Wish list on the Group's <a  href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/SSN_Wish_List">
        wiki </a> Of those, what is not covered elsewhere in this document is
      reproduced briefly here. Refer to the wish list for more detail, rationale
      and possible implementations.
