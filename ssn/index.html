      <p>The Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (commonly known as "SSN" or
        sometimes "SSNO") is an OWL-2 DL ontology for describing sensors and the
        observations they make of the physical world. SSN is published in a
        modular architecture that supports the judicious use of "just enough"
        ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large
        scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure,
        citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of
        its use are given.</p>
      <p  style="text-align: center;">The namespace for SSN terms is <span  class="repeated"
           style="font-family: courier;">http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/</span>
      </p>
      <p  style="text-align: center;">The suggested prefix for the SSN namespace
        is <span  class="repeated"  style="font-family: courier;">ssn</span> </p>
      <p  style="text-align: center;"> The SSN ontology itself is available <a

      <p>This is the second published draft of the SSN since its original
        publication by the SSN-XG, the Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group
        of the W3C. This is a very incomplete draft to indicate the scope and
        style of changes proposed to be made to the original SSN. This document
        is both incomplete and inconsistent, but is being published at this
        stage to solicit comment from the community of SSN users and would-be
        users.</p>
      <p><strong>For OGC</strong> This is a Public Draft of a document prepared
        by the Spatial Data on the Web Working Group (<a  href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">SDWWG</a>)
        — a joint W3C-OGC project (see <a  href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter">charter</a>).
        The document is prepared following W3C conventions. The document is
        released at this time to solicit public comment.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p> Sensor observations are a major source of data published on the Web.
        Yet, publishing, searching, reusing, and integrating this data requires
        more than just the observation values. Of equal importance is
        information about the studied feature of interest, such as a river, the
        observed property, such as flow velocity, and the sampling strategy. The
        sampling location, instrumentation, and information about the deployment
        of the instruments on a sensor platform may also be required for proper
        interpretation. OGC's Sensor Web Enablement standards also provide a means to
        annotate sensors and their observations. However, these standards are
        not yet integrated and aligned with W3C Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data in particular,
        that are a key driver for creating and maintaining a global and densely
        interconnected graph of data. The W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator
        Group (SSN) addressed these issues by developing an ontology that spans
        multiple OGC standards and other specifications. </p>
		<p>
		Unlike its predecessors, the SSN is designed to offer four identifiable and coherent perspectives or use cases for  sensing, each of which may be used either independently or in concert with the other three. These perspectives are
		<dl>
		<dt>Sensors</dt> <dd>with a focus on what senses, how it senses, and what is sensed;</dd>
		<dt>Data</dt> <dd>with a focus on observations and metadata;</dd>
		<dt>Systems</dt> <dd>with a focus on systems of sensors; and</dd>
		<dt>Features</dt> <dd>with a  focus on physical features, properties of them,  what can  sense them, and  what observations of them are made.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		
		Based on
        this initial work, the following document specifies a revised,
        modularized, and extended version of the SSN.</p>

        all</p>
		
		Drawing on considerable implementation experience with SSN since it was first published, it is modified to solve some known problems and to reflect  developments in the Linked Data environment. An important one of these developments is the growth of interest in Internet of Things, where SSN has been experimented with but has been observed to be too big, too dependent on OWL reasoning, and missing some key concepts such as Actuation.
		
      Specifically,

        <li> The namespace has changed to a permanent W3C address. </li>
        <li>
          <p>The The DOLCE ultralite ontology (DUL) was previously imported into
            SSN and many SSN terms inherited from DUL terms. This has been
            redesigned into two separate ontology modules so that SSN can be
            used quite independently of DUL if desired. Those parts of SSN that
            use DUL terms have been separated into the <a  href="http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/dul">SSN
              Alignment with DUL ontology.</a> </p>
			    <!--
          <p  class="issue"  data-number="45">This DUL alignment does not yet

        </li>
        <li> Class Sensor has been moved up to become a direct subclass of
          dul:Object instead of dul:PhysicalObject. This is not expected to
          affect existing uses of SSN due to dul:Object being a direct parent of
          dul:PhysicalObject. This is to correct the dul alignment to match the intended scope of ssn:Sensor as it was (and still is) described in the rdfs:comment property.
          <!-- <p  class="issue"  data-number="46">The movement of Sensor to become a
            direct subclass of dul:Object has been discussed but postponed by
            the Working Group</p> -->
			
        </li>
        <li> Many rdfs:comment annotation properties have changed slightly to
          improve explanation or to correct minor errors.
          <p  class="issue"  data-number="47">A thorough check and rewrite where necessary on annotation

      <h2>Modularisation</h2>
      <p> </p>
      <p>One of the major issue <span  data-dobid="hdw">practitioners</span> using the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology as defined in the XG is
        its complexity, partly due to the layering underneath the DOLCE
        UltraLite Upperlevel ontology. In response to this, the new Semantic Sensor Network ontology offers several ontology subsets that are mainly distinguished through their ontological commitment. This section explains the rationale and
        method for modularising SSN, i.e. offering several ontology files that are similar in their domain of discourse, but with different ontological commitments, suitable to several use cases.</p>
      <p>Ontology modularisation is a common method investigated in ontology
        engineering to segment an ontology into smaller parts. In general,
        ontology modularisation aims at providing users of ontologies with the
        knowledge they require, reducing the scope as much as possible to what
        is strictly necessary in a given use case. Two main categories of
        ontology modularisation can be distinguished.</p>
      <p>The first category comprises of approaches that focus on the
        composition of existing ontologies by means of integrating and mapping
        ontologies, most commonly through <code>owl:import</code> statements.
        OWL import has a direction from a source ontology to a target ontology,
        and although it is transitive, it only supports knowledge propagation in
        one direction, i.e. the importing ontology captures all the meaning of
        the imported terms used, i.e., it includes all axioms relevant to the
        meaning of these terms, however, the imported ontology may not capture
        any of the semantics of the importing ontology.</p>
      <p>The second category comprises of mapping approaches that aim to
        partition and extract parts of ontologies as modules. These mapping
        approaches are not necessarily directional, but most approaches of
        ontology extraction rely on directionality of the imported modules. In
        fact in [Cuenca Grau et al 2009] it has been proven that in OWL DL,
        which is a syntactical variant of the Description Logic SHOIN, checking
        whether an ontology is in fact a module of an ontology given a
        vocabulary is an undecidable problem. However, the main feature of an
        ontology module under the second category is that it is self-contained,
        i.e., the module captures the meaning of the imported terms used by
        including all axioms relevant to the meaning of these terms. This means,
        that the result of certain reasoning tasks such as subsumption or query
        answering within a single module should be possible and result in the
        same answers without the need to access other modules of the ontology.</p>
      <p> In order to ensure this property, a solution has to be found for
        concepts in the ontology module that inherit object properties from
        concepts that are not in the module. One solution proposed by [Cuenca
        Grau et al] is to include the bottom concept for all such missing
        concepts. Another solution is to change the domain and range of an
        object property. Our modularisation approach uses two different methods
        depending on the directionality of the segmentation.</p>
      <img  alt="Ontology Modules"  src="images/modular_ontology.png">
      <p>Figure 1 gives an overview of the modules of the SSN ontology. The
        layering of the rings represents a vertical segmentation, as follows:<br>
      </p>
      <h3> Vertical Segmentation</h3>
      <p>Vertical modules are build upon each other, i.e. they directionally <code>owl:import</code>
        lower level modules. If a higher level module is used without importing
        its lower levels it may lead to inconsistencies or at least it will lead
        to different answers when reasoning over the module compared to
        reasoning over its complete stack of vertical ontology modules. However,
        lower level modules are independent of their higher level modules and
        logically consistent.</p>
      <p>For example, the Dolce-UltraLite Alignment ontology imports the SOSA core and the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology. However, in
        reverse, neither SOASA nor SSN import the Dolce-UltraLite Alignment ontology. This
        makes the SOSA core, with its lightweight semantics, truly independent of vertical modules that add more
        expressivity and further ontological commitments.</p>
      <p>Note that higher level here is not to be confused with upper level
        ontologies. Upper level ontologies are general knowledge ontologies that
        can be directionally imported in many domains, whereas our definition of
        higher level ontologies here refers to an ontology that extends one or
        several ontology modules to capture a larger part of a knowledge domain
        and/or combine knowledge domains.</p>

      <h2>Work Plan</h2>
      <p>This section identifies work that is planned to be done in the next
        iteration of the document. Comment on these topics and their priority is
        invited. </p>
      <p  class="issue"  data-number="49">Check and reconsider or redesign
        modularisation of SSN. See proposal in charter: noting the work to split
        the ontology into smaller sections to offer simplified access </p>
      <p>Modularisation of SSN might work like some of the following suggestions
        under discussion</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Clearly separate observation, sensor, and deployment parts. </li>
        <li> Disentangling SSN from DUL may require adding things to SSN that
          were otherwise needed from DUL, for example, measured values.
          <p  class="issue"  data-number="51">How do we replace those components
            of dul that seem to be core to ssn if dul is not being used? </p>
        </li>
        <li> Consider O&amp;M alignment (see O&amp;Mlite). Assuming the DUL
          separation above works well, the O&amp;M alignment could be handled
          the same way. There is a known issue with incompatibility with SSN+DUL
          and O&amp;M resulting from a difference in modelling observations. </li>
      </ol>
      <p  class="issue"  data-number="52">What goes in SSN and what should be
        just a recommended profile/extract/extension? These could include e.g.
        WoT? Iot-lite? satellite sensors? samples? human sensors? Or do we just
        advise how to do this in general? </p>
      <p  class="issue"  data-number="67">Given the distinction between records
        and events, ssn:Observation is not the same concept as om:Observation.
        This arises also in alignment with PROV-O</p>
      <p  class="issue"  data-number="53"> Align SSN with PROV-O </p>
      <p>Two such alignments have already been published in the literature. One
        proposal functions mostly rather like the alignment to DUL as described
        above in form, but some rather useful SWRL is also used.</p>
      <p  class="issue"  data-number="54">Is it ok to use SWRL, too, for this?
        Or would it be better to make some bigger changes to SSN to align with
        PROV-O?</p>
      <p  class="issue"  data-number="11">Is the provenance requirement in
        scope?</p>
      <p  class="issue"  data-number="55"> Align SSN with RDF datacube </p>
      This alignment is necessary, at least, for the common use case of sensored
      time-series. There are a few examples in the literature, but it is
      suggested that some structural change to core SSN is needed to make this
      work. This needs to be considered in the context of the DUL
      disentanglement above because the encoding of measured values is important
      here. Observed properties also need to be checked.
      <p  class="issue"  data-number="56"> SSN for IoT devices </p>
      This could be achieved by defining a small SSN module that is suitable for
      small devices; by adopting IoT-lite or some other IoT ontology with a
      well-defined relationship to SSN (ie a formalised alignment). There are
      suggestions to reduce memory by short uris and labels (and annotations?),
      too.
      <p> In this context actuation is a clear need and should be considered. </p>
      <p> The user should be able to understand the network resource cost of
        proposed instructions (for example, power required per measurement,
        current battery life, latency before instructions can be executed).
        These qualities could be interpreted by the scientist user directly, or
        by an automated agent aiming to optimize network efficiency through
        resource scheduling and optimisation algorithms. </p>
      <p  class="issue"  data-number="57"> Align SSN with the ontology developed
        for the coverage deliverable </p>
      We would like to show that the sensors that observe coverage (commonly
      satellite, but could be in-situ ground-based sensors) can be described
      using SSN while their observations can be described via the SDW coverage
      deliverable.
      <p  class="issue"  data-number="58"> Extend SSN to cover requirements
        identified in our UCR</p>
      These should be done by optional extensions to SSN, in the style of the
      optional DUL alignment above, so as to minimally impact existing users and
      to avoid overcrowding of the core. The requirements are recorded in the <a
         href="www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#arSSN">UCR
        document </a>
      <p  class="issue"  data-number="42"> Align SSN to implement Best
        Practices as defined in our BP deliverable.</p>
      In particular, the modelling of time and space should concur. SSN should
      tighten its modelling of location. There are relevant UCR requirements for
      this.
      <p  class="issue"  data-number="59"> Extend SSN to to cover requirements
        identified in our wish List. These requirements have not been discussed
        in the group and are subject to prioritisation and resources.</p>
      See the Wish list on the Group's <a  href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/SSN_Wish_List">
        wiki.</a> Of those, what is not covered elsewhere in this document is
      reproduced briefly here. Refer to the wish list for more detail, rationale
      and possible implementations.

      <ol>
		<li> The Dolce Ultra Lite ontology, that was imported in to ssn, is no longer imported and all axioms using terms from DUL have been removed from SSN and collected in the DUL-SSN alignment ontology.
		</li>
		<li> The namespace was changed to match the planned namespace for this publication.
			</li>
	
	  </ol>	  
	  
      <p>	Changes since the FPWD (http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-vocab-ssn-20160531/) include...
	  <ol>
		<li>  
			Correction to include some ssn terms that were unintentionally dropped from the FPWD. Correction to remove an asserted subclass of owl:Thing that was introduced into FPWD (these were both by-products of Dolce removal).
		</li>
		<li> Correction to some https namespace usage that crept into the FPWD </li>
		<li> Transition to the new namespace used by the DUL ontology</li>
	  <li> ssn:Sensor has been changed to be a subclass of dul:Object instead of dul:Physical Object </li>
	  <li> Various typography and spelling errors and consistency of expression in annotation properties have been improved. These do not induce any changes in the intended meaning of the terms. </li>
