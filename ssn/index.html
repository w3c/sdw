SSN is published in a modular architecture that supports the judicious use of "just enough" ontology for diverse applications, including satellite imagery, large scale scientific monitoring, industrial and household infrastructure, citizen observers, and Web of Things. SSN is described and examples of its use are given.</p>

Of equal importance is        information about the studied feature of interest, such as a river, the        observed property, such as flow velocity,and the sampling strategy. The         sampling location, instrumentation, and information about        the deployment of the instruments on a sensor platform may also be required for propoer interpretation. OGC's Sensor        Web Enablement standards provide a means to annotate sensors and their        observations. However, these standards are not yet integrated and        aligned with paradigms such as Linked Data and W3C Semantic Web        technologies more generally, that are believed to be a key driver for        creating and maintaining a global and densely interconnected graph of        data. The W3C Semantic Sensor Network Incubator Group (SSN) addressed        these issues by developing an ontology that spans over multiple OGC        standards and other specifications to support the semantic lifting of        observations together with data about the sensors and their        capabilities, deployment information, and so forth. Based on this        initial work, the following document specifies a revised, modularized,        and extended version of the SSN.</p>    </section>

	Specifically,
	<ol>
	<li> The namespace has changed to a permanent W3C address.
	
	<li> The The DOLCE ultralite ontology (DUL)  was previously imported into SSN and many SSN terms inherited from DUL terms. This has been redesigned into two separate ontology modules so that SSN can be used quite independently of DUL if desired. Those parts of SSN that use DUL terms have been separated into the  <p <a  href="https://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/dul"> SSN Alignment with DUL ontology.</a></p>
	<p class="issue" data-number="">This DUL alignment does not yet reflect the recent change to the namespace of DUL itself.</p>
	
	<p>Please see section <a href='#Modularisation'></a> for more information. </p>
	
	<li> Class Sensor has been moved up to become a direct subclass of dul:Object instead of  dul:PhysicalObject. This is not expected to affect existing uses of SSN due to dul:Object being a direct parent of DUL:PhysicalObject. This is to clarify a popular misunderstanding of the intended scope of  ssn:Sensor which is correctly documented in the unaltered rdfs:comment property.
	<p class="issue" data-number="">The movement of Sensor to become a direct subclass of dul:Object has been discussed but postponed by the Working Group</p>

	     <section  id="Modularisation"  class="informative">      <h2>Modularisation</h2>      <p> </p>      <p>One of the major issues <span  data-dobid="hdw">practitioner</span>s        raised with the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology as defined in the XG is        its complexity, partly due to the layering underneath the DOLCE        UltraLite Upperlevel ontology. This section explains the rationale and        method for modularisation of the SSN.</p>
		      <p>Ontology modularisation is a common method investigated in ontology        engineering to segment an ontology into smaller parts. In general,        ontology modularization aims at providing users of ontologies with the        knowledge they require, reducing the scope as much as possible to what        is strictly necessary in a given use case. Two main categories of        ontology modularization can be distinguished.</p>      <p>The first category comprises of approaches that focus on the        composition of existing ontologies by means of integrating and mapping        ontologies, most commonly through <span  class"name"="">owl:import</span>        statements. OWL import has a direction from a source ontology to a        target ontology, and although it is transitive, it only supports        knowledge propagation in one direction, i.e. the importing ontology        captures all the meaning of the imported terms used, i.e., it includes        all axioms relevant to the meaning of these terms, however, the imported        ontology may not capture any of the semantics of the importing ontology.</p>      <p>The second category comprises of mapping approaches that aim to        partition and extract parts of ontologies as modules. These mapping        approaches are not necessarily directional, but most approaches of        ontology extraction rely on directionality of the imported modules. In        fact in [Cuenca Grau et al 2009] it has been proven that in OWL DL,        which is a syntactical variant of the Description Logic SHOIN, checking        whether an ontology is in fact a module of an ontology given a        vocabulary is an undecidable problem. However, the main feature of an        ontology module under the second category is that it is self-contained,        i.e., the module captures the meaning of the imported terms used by        including all axioms relevant to the meaning of these terms. This means,        that the result of certain reasoning tasks such as subsumption or query        answering within a single module should be possible and result in the        same answers without the need to access other modules of the ontology.</p>      <p> In order to ensure this property, a solution has to be found for        concepts in the ontology module that inherit object properties from        concepts that are not in the module. One solution proposed by [Cuenca        Grau et al] is to include the bottom concept for all such missing        concepts. Another solution is to change the domain and range of an        object property. Our modularisation approach uses two different methods        depending on the directionality of the segmentation.</p>      <img  alt="Ontology Modules"  src="images/modular_ontology.png">      <p>Figure 1 gives an overview of the modules of the SSN ontology. The        layering of the rings represents two methods of segmentation we        distinguish, horizontal and vertical segmentation, as follows:<br>      </p>      <h3> Vertical Segmentation</h3>      <p>Vertical modules are build upon each other, i.e. they directionally        owl:import lower level modules. If a higher level module is used without        importing its lower levels it may lead to inconsistencies or at least it        will lead to different answers when reasoning over the module compared        to reasoning over its complete stack of vertical ontology modules.        However, lower level modules are independent of their higher level        modules and logically consistent. Note that higher level here is not to        be confused with upper level ontologies. Upper level ontologies are        general knowledge ontologies that can be directionally imported in many        domains, whereas our definition of higher level ontologies here refers        to an ontology that extends one or several ontology modules to capture a        larger part of a knowledge domain and/or combine knowledge domains.<br>      </p>      <h3> Horizontal Segmentation</h3>      <p>Modules that are horizontally layered do not depend on each other, i.e.        they do not rely on the import of another horizontal module to lead to        the same answers when reasoning over the module itself as opposed to        reasoning over an imported horizontal module. If a concept in a module        is connected to a concept in another horizontally layered module through        a directional property such as a subClassOf relation or any asymmetric        property, the range concept of such a relation has to be included in the        module using the URI of the concept as it is defined in the other        module.</p>

Assuming the DUL          separation above works well, the O&amp;M alignment could be handled          the same way.

	       <p  class="issue"  data-number="">Is it ok to use SWRL, too, for this? Or        would it be better to make some bigger changes to SSN to align with        PROV-O?</p>

		         <p  class="issue"  data-number=""> Align SSN with RDF datacube </p>      This alignment is necessary, at least, for the common use case of sensored      time-series. There are a few examples in the literature, but it is      suggested that some structural change to core SSN is needed to make this      work. This needs to be considered in the context of the DUL      disentanglement above because the encoding of measured values is important      here. Observed properties also need to be checked.
	        <p  class="issue"  data-number=""> SSN for IoT devices </p>      This could be achieved by defining a small SSN module that is suitable for      small devices; by adopting IoT-lite or some other IoT ontology with a      well-defined relationship to SSN (ie a formalised alignment). There are      suggestions to reduce memory by short uris and labels (and annotations?),      too.      <p> In this context actuation is a clear need and should be considered. </p>      <p> The user should be able to understand the network resource cost of        proposed instructions (for example, power required per measurement,        current battery life, latency before instructions can be executed).        These qualities could be interpreted by the scientist user directly, or        by an automated agent aiming to optimise network efficiency through        resource scheduling and optimisation algorithms. </p>      <p  class="issue"  data-number=""> Align SSN with the ontology developed        for the coverage deliverable </p>      We would like to show that the sensors that observe coverage (commonly      satellite, but could be in-situ ground-based sensors) can be described      using SSN while their observations can be described via the SDW coverage      deliverable.      <p  class="issue"  data-number=""> Extend SSN to to cover requirements        identified in our UCR</p>      These should be done by optional extensions to SSN, in the style of the      optional DUL alignment above, so as to minimally impact existing users and      to avoid overcrowding of the core.
