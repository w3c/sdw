      <h2>Developments since the initial 2009 publication of SSN</h2>
	<p class="issue" data-number=""> Justify why we are changing SSN at all</p>	 
	
	Specifically,
	<ol>
	<li> The namespace has changed to a permanent W3C address.
	<li> Class Sensor has been moved up to become a direct subclass of dul:Object instead of  dul:PhysicalObject. This is not expected to affect existing uses of SSN due to dul:Object being a direct parent of DUL:PhysicalObject. This is to clarify a popular misunderstanding of the intended scope of  ssn:Sensor which is correctly documented in the unaltered rdfs:comment property. 
	<li> Many rdfs:comment annotation properties have changed slightly to improve explanation or to correct minor errors.
	<p class="issue" data-number="">A thorough check on annotation properties is yet to be made.</p>
	<li> The DUL ontology was previously imported into SSN and most SSN terms inherited from DUL terms. This has been redesigned into two separate ontology modules so that SSN can be used quite independently of DUL if desired. Please see section <a href='#Modularisation'></a> for more information. 
	</ol>

	<h2>Modularisation</h2>
      <p> This section explains the rationale and method for modularisation, together with a 'map' of the modules developed.
	  For now, the SSN-XG structure diagram is included (attribute to Laurent Lefort and Raul Garcia-Castro)

		<p>The modules contain the classes and properties that can be used
		to represent particular aspects of a sensor or its observations:
		for example, sensors, observations, features of interest, the
		process of sensing (i.e. how a sensor operates and observes), how
		sensors are deployed or attached to platforms, the measuring
		capabilities of sensors, as well as their environmental, and
		survival properties of sensors in particular environments.</p>

	<h2>The SSN ontology</h2>

	<section id="Work Plan" class="informative">
	<h2>Work Plan</h2>
      <p>This section identifies work that is planned to be done in the next iteration of the document. Comment on these topics and their priority is invited.
	  </p>
	   <p class="issue" data-number="">Check and reconsider or redesign modularisation of SSN. See proposal in charter: noting the work to split the ontology into smaller sections to offer simplified access </p>	   
	  
   Modularisation of SSN might work like some of the following suggestions under discussion
	<ol>
      <li>   Clearly separate observation, sensor, and deployment parts.
      <li>   Disentangle SSN from DUL (this may require adding things to SSN that are needed from DUL) <p class="note">A draft of this disentanglement is available on WebProtege. It functions by separating SSN components in one module and separately having an alignment module that maps the relationship between SSN and DUL. To include DUL with SSN, you should also use xxx the alignment  which imports DUL and links to the necessary SSN classes and properties. However, this means SSN used alone has no method for encoding measured values or some other things.
	   <p class="issue" data-number="">How do we replace those components of dul that seem to be core to ssn if dul is not being used? </p>
      <li>   Consider O&M alignment (see O&Mlite). Assuming the DUL separation above works well, the O&M alignment could be handled the same way. There is a known issue with incompatibility with SSN+DUL and O&M resulting from a difference in modelling observations.
	   <li> <p class="issue" data-number="">What goes in SSN and what should be just  a recommended profile/extract/extension? These could include 
	   e.g. Wot? Iot-lite? satelite sensors? samples? human sensors? Or do we just  advise how to do this in general? </p>
	  <p class="issue" data-number="">Given the distinction between records and events, ssn:Observation is not the same concept as om:Observation. This arises also in alignment with PROV-O</p> 
      <li>   Provide deeper OWL axiomatization (now that DUL is gone)
	   <p class="issue" data-number="">kjanowicz to explain what was intended by Provide deeper OWL axiomatization </p>
      <li>   
	</ol>
	   
	 <p class="issue" data-number="">Align SSN with PROV-O </p>	 
		Two such alignments have already been published in the literature. One proposal functions mostly rather like the alignment to DUL as described above in form, but some rather useful SWRL is also used.  <p class="issue" data-number="">Is it ok to use SWRL, too, for this? Or would it be better to make some bigger changes to SSN to align with PROV-O?</p> 
		<p class="issue" data-number="">We have an outstanding <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/track/issues/11">  issue-11: Is the provenance requirement in scope?</a></p>
    
    <p class="issue" data-number="">Align SSN with RDF datacube </p>
	This alignment is necessary, at least, for the common use case of sensored time-series. There are a few examples in the literature, but it is suggested that some structural change to core SSN is needed to make this work. This needs to be considered in the context of the DUL disentanglement above because the encoding of measured values is important here. Observed properties also need to be checked. 
	
	<p class="issue" data-number="">  SSN for IoT devices </p> 
	This could be achieved by defining a small SSN module that is suitable for small devices; by adopting IoT-lite or some other IoT ontology with a well-defined relationship to SSN (ie a formalised alignment). There are suggestions to reduce memory by short uris and labels (and annotations?), too.
	<p>
	In this context actuation is a clear need and should be considered.
	
	<p>
	The user should be able to understand the network resource cost of proposed instructions (for example, power required per measurement, current battery life, latency before instructions can be executed). These qualities could be interpreted by the scientist user directly, or by an automated agent aiming to optimise network efficiency through resource scheduling and optimisation algorithms.
	
   <p class="issue" data-number=""> Align SSN  with the ontology developed for the coverage deliverable </p>
    We would like to show that the sensors that observe coverage (commonly satellite, but could be in-situ ground-based sensors) can be described using SSN while their observations can be described via the SDW coverage deliverable. 
	
	<p class="issue" data-number="" > Extend SSN to to cover requirements identified in our UCR</p>
	
	These should be done by optional extensions to SSN, in the style of the optional DUL alignment above, so as to minimally impact existing users and to avoid overcrowding of the core.  The requirements are recorded in the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/sdw/UseCases/SDWUseCasesAndRequirements.html#arSSN">    UCR document </a></p>
	
	
	<p class="issue" data-number="" > Align SSN to to implement Best Practices as defined in our BP deliverable.</p>
	In particular, the modelling of time and space should concur. SSN should tighten its modelling of location. There are relevant UCR requirements for this.
	
	<p class="issue" data-number="" > Extend SSN to to cover requirements identified in our wish List</p>
	 See the Wish list on the Group's <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/SSN_Wish_List"> wiki </a>
	 Of those, what is not covered elsewhere in this document is  reproduced  briefly here. Refer to the wish list for more detail, rationale and possible implementations.

		<h2>Documentation</h2>
		<ol>
		<li> 	Success Stories (also called use cases) as a way to understand whether SSN is the right tool for the job
		
		<li> Tutorial Introduction to SSN and documentation for new users in general. Make a video version of the tutorial. (Given the expected user group for all the outputs of this WG, this idea should really extend to all the deliverables of the WG)

		<li> Reasoning and other Inference 
	

SSN uses lots of OWL that enables reasoning support for clever stuff. This should be explained (how to leverage it?).
