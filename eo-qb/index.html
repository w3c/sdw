      <p>This document describes how dense geospatial raster data can be represented using the W3C RDF Data Cube (QB)  ontology [[vocab-data-cube]] in concert with other popular ontologies including the W3C/OGC  Semantic Sensor Network ontology (SSN) [[vocab-ssn]], the W3C/OGC Time ontology (Time) [[owl-time]], the W3C Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS) [[skos-reference]], W3C PROV-O [[prov-o]] and the W3C/OGC QB4ST  [[qb4st]]. It offers general methods supported by worked examples that focus on Earth observation imagery.
Current triple stores, as the default database architecture for RDF, are not suitable  for storing voluminous data like imagery derived from Landsat satellite sensors. We show how SPARQL queries can be served through an OGC Discrete Global Grid System for observations, coupled with a triple store for observational metadata.
While the approach  may also be suitable for other forms of coverage data, we leave the  application to such data as an exercise for the reader.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Publishing data on the Web using <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data">Linked Data</a>
      technologies makes it more accessible, easier to discover, and machine-readable.
      This format is appropriate for sparse statistical data, but publishers of denser coverage data
      (such as <a href="http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Landsat</a> imagery) may be justifiably reluctant to embrace the size explosion that
      accompanies converting data to RDF. While such a conversion provides maximum machine-readability,
      most of the benefits of Linked Data can be realized with a compromise approach where only the
      metadata is expressed in RDF, or where the RDF is generated on-the-fly to service requests.</p>

      <h2>The RDF Data Cube</h2>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">RDF Data Cube</a> is an existing standard for representing data as RDF.  
         It is typically used for data that is associated with statistical regions (e.g. suburbs).
         Common practice includes using the SKOS vocabulary to define the concepts being measured
         [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#ObservedPropertyInCoverage">Observed property in coverage</a>].
         The RDF data model allows the user to define all the relevant components of their data and the concept they measure;
         including &ldquo;attribute&rdquo; components (metadata like sensor, resolution, uncertainty
         [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#QualityPerSample">Quality per sample</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#UncertaintyInObservations">Uncertainty in observations</a>] etc.),
         &ldquo;measure&rdquo; components (the data proper) and &ldquo;dimension&rdquo; components
         (the domain of the dataset e.g. the time and statistical region each datum refers to).
         These techniques can easily be adapted to coverages, as the data model is flexible enough to define the appropriate attributes.</p>

      <p>The ontology <abbr title="Data Cube extensions for spatio-temporal components">QB4ST</abbr> [[qb4st]] extends the Data Cube for extra power and consistency when describing spatio-temporal aspects of data. [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#GeoreferencedData">Georeferenced spatial data</a>].
         Any number of such dimensions can be defined, allowing for 1D, 2D, 3D or 4D coverages [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#3DSupport">Support for 3D</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#TimeSeries">Time series</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#4DModelSpaceTime">4D model of space-time</a>].</p>

      <section  id="Metadata">
        <h3>Metadata and data</h3>
        <p>There is traditionally a distinction between data (the observations proper e.g. Landsat pixels) and metadata
           (which adds context to the observations e.g. resolution). In the Linked Data world, this distinction is not strict.
           However, it is still possible to separate the two in a typical Data Cube.</p>
            
        <p>The value of an RDF Data Cube component can be attached to each individual observation or to the dataset as a whole.
           Dataset-wide metadata can therefore be distinguished from the rest of the dataset, because it is attached to the dataset object.
           This also makes it easy to fetch the metadata alone with a SPARQL query. This dataset-wide description alone is already a useful
           (and web-of-data friendly) approach to publishing spatial data
           [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#SpatialMetadata">Spatial metadata</a>].</p>

        <p>Using the RDF Data Cube also opens up the possibility of more detailed metadata, such as individually tracing
           the provenance of each observation. It is not practical to serve Landsat imagery with RDF metadata attached
           to each pixel. However, it is reasonable to attach such metadata to tiles of a certain size.
           Thus, the RDF data model can be used, as long as RDF Data Cube observations are whole tiles rather than individual pixels [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#TilingSupport">Support for tiling</a>].

    <section  id="Spectrum">
      <h2>A spectrum of linkiness</h2>
      <p>In the ideal web of data, every single observation has a unique URI, can be queried using SPARQL, and have metadata attached to it.
         Upon hearing this, anyone familiar with Landsat data would be forgiven for rejecting the whole enterprise as entirely impractical.
         But all is not lost! Most of the benefits of Linked Data (namely, linkability, enhanced discoverability, machine-readability) can
         be realized by just publishing the dataset-wide metadata in this format. More 'linkiness' provides diminishing returns along with increasing costs.
         It is up to the publisher to decide where along this spectrum is the compromise position appropriate for them.</p>

      <p>To characterize the spectrum, we can broadly define three applications of RDF for coverages.
         From most to least costly, these are: to store a coverage dataset, to serve a coverage (&ldquo;serialization&rdquo;), and to describe the metadata of a coverage (&ldquo;description&rdquo;).</p>

      <section  id="Storing">
            <h3>Storing a coverage</h3>
            <p>RDF data is stored natively in a triple store. The Data Cube, and RDF in general, are too verbose to be viable for large coverages.</p>
      </section>

      <section  id="Serving">
          <h3>Serving a coverage</h3>
          <p>In this model, coverage data is stored in some more appropriate format (such as HDF5).
             Specialized middleware receives SPARQL queries from a client and responds by sending a response in dynamically-generated RDF.
             Such a response is fairly verbose, but the cost is much smaller than actually storing the whole coverage in RDF.
             Further optimization is still necessary for this to be viable. It is possible to use tiles as the &ldquo;observations&rdquo; in the RDF Data Cube,
             rather than individual pixels [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#TilingSupport">Support for tiling</a>].
             This significantly reduces the blowup that comes from encoding data as RDF [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#Compressible">Compressible</a>].</p>

          <p>The advantage of serving a coverage in RDF is that the entire coverage, and individual tiles within it, become linkable
             [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#Linkability">Linkability</a>];
             this could be a major contribution to the Linked Data Web. With sufficiently advanced middleware, SPARQL queries over the dataset
             could be served just as if the data were stored in RDF, but for a fraction of the storage cost.
             The publisher can thus leverage the full power of Linked Data.</p>

          <p>It is common to want only a chunk of the data available. For example, all observations near (within 10km of) Canberra, in the past year.
             The RDF Data Cube provides only for &ldquo;slices&rdquo; &mdash; predefined chunks that hold one or more dimensions constant. Unfortunately, this is an area where the Data Cube is
             insufficiently powerful for coverages. When data is stored and served in some other format, it is up to the publisher to provide ways for the consumer to
             acquire only certain chunks of the data. If serving coverage data using RDF, a possible approach is to use SPARQL queries to define the appropriate chunks
             [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#ReferenceDataChunks">Reference data chunks</a>]
             (for example, a query returning all tiles of a certain resolution within a certain spatial rectangle).
             Even if using this method, publishers should still make it easy for a user to select chunks without the use of SPARQL,
             e.g. by providing an interface to generate the appropriate query using a few predefined operators.</p>
      </section>

      <section  id="Describing">
          <h3>Describing a coverage</h3>
          <p>A large portion of the benefits of Linked Data may be realized by describing only the metadata of a coverage in RDF.
             Then the dataset can be linked to [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#Linkability">Linkability</a>], and its essential properties are naturally machine-readable [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#Discoverability">Discoverability</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#MachineToMachine">Machine to machine</a>].
             The coverage itself can remain in whatever efficient format the publisher prefers.</p>

          <p>No matter what approach is taken, it should be as easy as possible
             for the user to grab <strong>just</strong> the metadata, without having to figure out how to write an appropriate query.
              The definition of a <code>qb:DataSet</code> and the associated <code>qb:DataStructureDefinition</code> can serve this role, but it is still up to the
             publisher to make it easy for the user to download those definitions. This is also the appropriate place to think
             about the experience of Web crawlers on the publisher's Web page [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#Crawlability">Crawlability</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#MachineToMachine">Machine to machine</a>].</p>

          <p>It is also helpful if the user can easily identify the domain of a coverage (the spatial and temporal area where measurements are taken)
             [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#SpatialMetadata">Spatial metadata</a>].
             <abbr title="Data Cube extensions for spatio-temporal components">QB4ST</abbr> [[qb4st]] does not currently have a term for that, but it may in the future.</p>

      <h2>Discrete Global Grid Systems</h2>
      <p>Discrete global grid systems are a family of spatial reference systems that subdivide the Earth's surface into a hierarchy of cells.
      Larger cells are subdivided into smaller cells deeper in the hierarchy.
      Instead of a latitude and longitude, a location is specified by a cell id. Smaller cells are more precise, 
      so choosing a cell forces the publisher to include a measure of uncertainty for any spatial measure.
      Cells are also appropriate units of tiling for gridded coverages. Each pixel in a tile covering a larger cell can represent a measurement made on a smaller cell.
      The OGC is currently in the process of <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/dggsswg">standardizing</a> a method to represent DGGSs.</p>
      
      <p>The  <a href="ANU-LED-example.ttl">ANU-LED example</a> in this document does not depend on the use of a DGGS.  However, the DGGS has some convenient properties that make it particularly suitable for a Linked Data representation.
      First, each <abbr title="Discrete Global Grid Systems">DGGS</abbr> cell has a unique identifier, so it is easy to generate natural URIs for each piece of data.
      Second, the DGGS we use (<a href="http://raichev.net/files/rhealpix_dggs_preprint.pdf">rHEALPix</a>, PDF) defines cell geometries so that cells at the same level of the hierarchy have equal areas.
      This makes rHEALPix a suitable format for storing multiple datasets at different resolutions, or several different resolution views of the same dataset.
      The equal-area constraint means different resolution pixels are directly comparable, and no resampling is required [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#AvoidCoordinateTransformations">Avoid coordinate transformations</a>].
      Third, the hierarchical nature of the DGGS makes it natural to implement spatial optimizations when responding to queries, by pruning the tree early to eliminate whole regions of unpromising cells that fall outside the desired area.
	  
	  Data structures other than DGGS, such as n-dimensional gridded data, whether geospatial or not, and hierarchies of data such as tile sets, octree or quadtree structures, are also amenable to these approaches.

        <h3>Implementation</h3>

        <p>A proof of concept demonstrating the <a href="ANU-LED-example.ttl">ANU-LED example</a> with a SPARQL query system to
            retrieve satellite imagery has been implemented. 
			<!--based on latitude/longitude or DGGS cell IDs has been implemented as a proof of concept--> This section briefly
            describes some of the strategies employed to make the implementation
            efficient. All code referenced here is available on <a

        </p>

        <p>As discussed previously, scalable implementations of a data cube
            for Earth observations must grapple with the verbosity of RDF
            representations relative to specialized coverage formats like GeoTIFF. This
            precludes materializing the entire dataset as RDF, storing it on
            disk, and serving it using an off-the-shelf triple store. Instead,
            implementations must employ a &ldquo;virtual graph&rdquo;, which can
            be used to service SPARQL queries without materializing all triples
            at once.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the purpose of illustrating how triple stores service SPARQL
            queries &mdash; regardless of whether they are backed by virtual or
            materialized graphs &mdash; consider the query below.
        </p>

        <pre class="example">SELECT ?s ?v WHERE {
    ?s a :egType ;
        rdfs:label "Example" ;
        :value ?v .
    FILTER (?v &lt; 15)
}</pre>

        <p>
            The heart of the query above is a Basic Graph Pattern (BGP) which
            specifies the triples to be accessed. In this case,
            the BGP contains three patterns. Written explicitly, they are:
        </p>

        <pre class="example">?s a :egType .
?s rdfs:label "Example" .
?s :value ?v .</pre>

        <p>
            A typical triple store will begin servicing the query above by
            iterating through each triple pattern in turn. First, a set of
            bindings for <code>?s</code> will be generated that are consistent
            with <code>?s a :egType</code>. That set of bindings will then be
            filtered by matching them against the pattern <code>?s rdfs:label
            "Example"</code>. The final <code>?s :value ?v</code> will further
            filter the bindings for <code>?s</code> by considering only subjects
            <code>?s</code> with a <code>:value</code> property; it will also
            introduce a corresponding set of bindings for <code>?v</code>.
            Having generated all bindings relevant to the BGP, a typical triple
            store will then apply the <code>FILTER</code> condition to each. This
            general approach works for both traditional storage backends (like
            on-disk RDF databases) and non-traditional ones (like virtual
            graphs).
        </p>

        <p>
            There are a number of ways in which this naive, pattern-by-pattern
            approach can be improved. We have implemented two simple extensions:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                User-supplied triple patterns often generate useful constraints
                on the data returned by a SPARQL query. For example, the pattern
                <code>?s :dggsLevelSquare 5 .</code> might allow a virtual graph
                implementation to ignore all observations not corresponding to cells
                at the fifth level of the DGGS hierarchy. In a naive
                implementation, only one such constraint can be considered at a
                time; this makes heuristics like query ordering essential. In
                contrast, a virtual graph implementation can simultaneously
                consider <em>all</em> supplied constraints in conjunction. For
                instance, if the user specifies <code>?s :dggsLevelSquare 5;
                :etmBand 3</code>, then the virtual graph implementation can
                safely narrow its search to observations at level 5 of the DGGS
                hierarchy which correspond to Landsat's third ETM band.
            </li>
            <li>
                Consumers of spatial datasets typically want only a small
                spatial slice of the available data. In SPARQL, such a slice can
                be identified by a <code>FILTER</code> statement restricting the
                appropriate location properties. By inspecting the contents of
                <code>FILTER</code> statements, virtual graph implementations
                can preemptively narrow the set of bindings they generate to
                include only bindings which are spatially relevant. In general,
                this approach can yield excellent gains when the spatial extent
                of queries is small relative to the spatial extent of the
                overall dataset.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            These simple optimizations can improve query time substantially.
            Consider the following SPARQL query, which fetches the intensity
            (<code>?val</code>) and URI (<code>?s</code>) associated with each
            single-pixel observation in a satellite imagery database.
        </p>

        <pre class="example">SELECT DISTINCT ?s ?val WHERE {
    ?s a led:Pixel
        ; led:etmBand "1"^^xsd:int
        ; led:dggsLevelSquare "5"^^xsd:int
        ; led:latMin ?latMin
        ; led:longMax ?longMax
        ; led:value ?val.
    # Everything north-west of Parliament House
    FILTER (?latMin > -35.3082
        &amp;&amp; ?longMax &lt; 149.1244)
}</pre>

        <p>
            The above query was executed on a 500MB HDF5 dataset containing over
            4000 distinct observations. Repeating the query a thousand times
            with ten concurrent clients on a desktop machine yielded the
            following mean running times. In the following, the &ldquo;naive&rdquo; implementation
            simply iterates through the BGP specified above on a
            pattern-by-pattern basis, subsequently passing results to
            the SPARQL engine for evaluation against the filter constraint.
            &ldquo;Multiple pattern-matching&rdquo; corresponds to the first
            optimization identified above, and &ldquo;additional spatial
            optimizations&rdquo; refers to a combination of the first and second
            optimizations.
        </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Implementation</th>
                <th>Mean runtime (Â± standard deviation)</th>
            <tr>
                <td>Naive</td>
                <td>378ms (Â±65.5ms)</td>

                <td>
                    35ms (Â±22.2ms)

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            &ldquo;Multiple-pattern matching&rdquo; is a relatively simple
            optimization, yet is sufficient to improve query performance
            tenfold. Accounting for the bounding box constraint specified in the
            query improves performance by another factor of two. It is likely
            that further performance gains could be found with more
            sophisticated optimizations. In particular, servicing queries with
            spatial restrictions could be further improved by employing an
            R-tree or some other specialized spatial data structure.
        </p>

          <p>The dataset is consumed by a web-based client application created using AngularJS. The client queries the server using SPARQL queries passed through through GET requests. The server respones with the relevent information encoded as JSON. In our instance, we query the server based off time and location for the relevent coverage images. The coverage data is overlayed onto an existing mapping library and displayed for the user. Additonal information is displayed in an informational sidebar.</p>

          <p>We note that while this gives the client creator maximum flexibility in writing their own SPARQL queries, this implies that they are also responsible for the efficient management of the responses. In our work, we found that our queries performed worse compared to the pre-existing mapping library as it lacked the necessary caching and optimisation to perform at the same speed.</p>

          <h3>Latitude and longitude</h3>
          <p>The working group wishes to discourage unqualified uses of &ldquo;latitude&rdquo; and &ldquo;longitude&rdquo;.
             Most commonly, these terms refer to the WGS-84 Coordinate Reference System (CRS),
             but published data should always make its CRS explicit [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#Georectification">Georectification</a>].
             In RDF, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/">WGS-84 geo vocabulary</a> is often used,
              with its provided <code>geo:lat</code> and <code>geo:long</code> properties.
             The working group intends to standardize better properties, which allow the use of other CRSs.
             Once these exist, they should always be used in place of the geo properties.
              QB4ST defines the <code>qb4st:crs</code> property which will inherit from those
