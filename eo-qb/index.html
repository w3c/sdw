      <p>This document describes how dense spatial data can be represented using the existing RDF Data Cube ontology.
         The Data Cube is not a suitable format for storing voluminous data, such as Landsat imagery, but it can be used to
         serve the data in a format compatible with the linked data web. Alternatively, encoding just the metadata in RDF
         already provides most of the benefits of using linked data, without the potential size explosion.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Publishing data on the web using <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data">linked data</a>
      technologies makes it more accessible, easier to discover, and machine-readable.
      This format is appropriate for sparse statistical data, but publishers of denser coverage data
      (such as Landsat imagery) may be justifiably reluctant to embrace the size explosion that
      accompanies converting data to RDF. While such a conversion provides maximum machine-readability,
      most of the benefits of linked data can be be realised with a compromise approach where only the
      metadata is expressed in RDF, or where the RDF is generated on-the-fly to service requests.</p>

      <p>This document will refer to extracts of a small example to illustrate the approach. The complete source file is the

      <h2>The RDF Data Cube</h2>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">RDF Data Cube</a> is an existing standard for representing data as RDF.
         It is typically used for data that is associated with statistical regions (e.g. suburbs).
         Common practice includes using the SKOS vocabulary to define the concepts being measured
         [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#ObservedPropertyInCoverage">Observed property in coverage</a>].
         The RDF data model allows the user to define all the relevant components of their data and the concept they measure;
         including "attribute" components (metadata like sensor, resolution, uncertainty
         [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#QualityMetadata">Quality metadata</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#UncertaintyInObservations">Uncertainty in observations</a>] etc.),
         "measure" components (the data proper) and "dimension" components
         (the domain of the dataset e.g. the time and statistical region each datum refers to).
         These techniques can easily be adapted to coverages, as the data model is flexible enough to define the appropriate attributes.</p>

      <p>The ontology <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/RDF_Datacube_for_Coverages">QB4ST</a> extends the Data Cube for extra power when describing gridded data,
         by defining terms for spatial dimensions (and, in the future, temporal dimensions) [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#GeoreferencedData">Georeferenced spatial data</a>].
         Any number of such spatial dimensions can be defined, allowing for 1D, 2D, 3D or 4D coverages [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#3DSupport">Support for 3D</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#TimeSeries">Time series</a>, <a href="http://w3c.github.io/sdw/UseCases/SDWUseCasesAndRequirements.html#4DModelSpaceTime">4D model of space-time</a>].</p>

      <section  id="Metadata">
        <h3>Metadata and data</h3>
        <p>There is traditionally a distinction between data (the observations proper e.g. Landsat pixels) and metadata
           (which adds context to the observations e.g. resolution). In the linked data world, this distinction is not strict.
           However, it is still possible to separate the two in a typical Data Cube.</p>
            
        <p>The value of an RDF Data Cube component can be attached to each individual observation or to the dataset as a whole.
           Dataset-wide metadata can therefore be distinguished from the rest of the dataset, because it is attached to the dataset object.
           This also makes it easy to fetch the metadata alone with a SPARQL query. This dataset-wide description alone is already a useful
           (and web-of-data friendly) approach to publishing spatial data
           [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#SpatialMetadata">Spatial metadata</a>].</p>

        <p>Using the RDF Data Cube also opens up the possibility of more detailed metadata, such as individually tracing
           the provenance of each observation. It is not practical to serve Landsat imagery with RDF metadata attached
           to each pixel. However, it is reasonable to attach such metadata to tiles of a certain size.
           Thus, the RDF data model can be used, as long as RDF Data Cube observations are whole tiles rather than individual pixels [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#TilingSupport">Support for tiling</a>].

    <section  id="Spectrum"  class="informative">
      <h2>A spectrum of linkiness</h2>
      <p>In the ideal web of data, every single observation has a unique URI, can be queried using SPARQL, and have metadata attached to it.
         Upon hearing this, anyone familiar with Landsat data would be forgiven for rejecting the whole enterprise as entirely impractical.
         But all is not lost! Most of the benefits of linked data (namely, linkability, enhanced discoverability, machine-readability) can
         be realised by just publishing the dataset-wide metadata in this format. More linkiness provides diminishing returns along with with increasing costs.
         It is up to the publisher to decide where along this spectrum is the compromise position appropriate for them.</p>

      <p>To charactise the spectrum, we can broadly define three applications of RDF for coverages.
         From most to least costly, these are: to store a coverage dataset, to serve a coverage ("serialisation"), and to describe the metadata of a coverage ("description").</p>

      <section  id="Storing">
            <h3>Storing a coverage</h3>
            <p>RDF data is stored natively in a triple store. The Data Cube, and RDF in general, are too verbose to be viable for large coverages.</p>
      </section>

      <section  id="Serving">
          <h3>Serving a coverage</h3>
          <p>In this model, coverage data is stored in some more appropriate format (such as HDF5).
             Specialised middleware receives SPARQL queries from a client and responds by sending a response in dynamically-generated RDF.
             Such a response is fairly verbose, but the cost is much smaller than actually storing the whole coverage in RDF.
             Further optimisation is still necessary for this to be viable. It is possible to use tiles as the "observations" in the RDF datacube,
             rather than individual pixels [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#TilingSupport">Support for tiling</a>].
             This significantly reduces the blowup that comes from encoding data as RDF [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#Compressible">Compressible</a>].</p>

          <p>The advantage of serving a coverage in RDF is that the entire coverage, and individual tiles within it, become linkable
             [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#Linkability">Linkability</a>];
             this could be a major contribution to the linked data web. With sufficiently advanced middleware, SPARQL queries over the dataset
             could be served just as if the data were stored in RDF, but for a fraction of the storage cost.
             The publisher can thus leverage the full power of linked data.</p>

          <p>It is common to want only a chunk of the data available. For example, all observations near (within 10km of) Canberra, in the past year.
             The RDF Data Cube provides only for "slices" &mdash; predefined chunks that hold one or more dimensions constant. Unfortunately, this is an area where the Data Cube is
             insufficiently powerful for coverages. When data is stored and served in some other format, it is up to the publisher to provide the consumer ways to
             acquire only certain chunks of the data. If serving coverage data using RDF, a possible approach is to use SPARQL queries to define the appropriate chunks
             [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#ReferenceDataChunks">Reference data chunks</a>]
             (for example, a query returning all tiles of a certain resolution within a certain spatial rectangle).
             Even if using this method, publishers should still make it easy for a user to select chunks without the use of SPARQL,
             e.g. by providing an interface to generate the appropriate query using a few predefined operators.</p>
      </section>

      <section  id="Describing">
          <h3>Describing a coverage</h3>
          <p>A large portion of the benefits of linked data may be realised by describing only the metadata of a coverage in RDF.
             Then the dataset can be linked to [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#Linkability">Linkability</a>], and its essential properties are naturally machine-readable [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#Discoverability">Discoverability</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#MachineToMachine">Machine to machine</a>].
             The coverage itself can remain in whatever efficient format the publisher prefers.</p>

          <p>No matter what approach is taken, it should be as easy as possible
             for the user to grab <strong>just</strong> the metadata, without having to figure out how to write an appropriate query.
             The definition of a qb:DataSet and the associated qb:DataStructureDefinition can serve this role, but it is still up to the
             publisher to make it easy for the user to download those definitions. This is also the appropriate place to think
             about the experience of web crawlers on the publisher's webpage [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#Crawlability">Crawlability</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#MachineToMachine">Machine to machine</a>].</p>

          <p>It is also helpful if the user can easily identify the domain of a coverage (the spatial and temporal area where measurements are taken)
             [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#SpatialMetadata">Spatial metadata</a>].
             QB4ST does not currently have a term for that, but it may in the future.</p>

          <h3>Latitude and longitude</h3>
          <p>The working group wishes to discourage unqualified uses of "latitude" and "longitude".
             Most commonly, these terms refer to the WGS-84 CRS (coordinate reference system),
             but published data should always make its CRS explicit [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#Georectification">Georectification</a>].
             In RDF, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/">WGS-84 geo vocabulary</a> is often used,
             with its provided geo:lat and geo:long properties.
             The working group intends to standardise better properties, which allow the use of other CRSs.
             Once these exist, they should always be used in place of the geo properties.
             QB4ST defines the qb4st:crs property which will inherit from those
             [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#CRSDefinition">CRS definition</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#SpatialMetadata">Spatial metadata</a>].</p>

          <h3>GeoSPARQL</h3>
          <p>The GeoSPARQL ontology defines some terms and predicates for reasoning about objects and shapes in space
             [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#SpatialOperators">Spatial operators</a>].
             It allows for the use of several encodings, including WKT, to describe polygons
             [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#EncodingForVectorGeometry">Encoding for vector geometry</a>].
             The ANU-LED example uses these terms to define the area covered by individual tiles in the coverage, and the entire spatial domain.</p>

          <h3>SKOS concepts</h3>
          <p>The Data Cube is commonly used in conjunction with a SKOS concept scheme
             (such as <a href="http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx">SDMX-RDF</a> and its <a href="http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/concept">concept scheme</a>)
             to define the meanings of the components [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#ObservedPropertyInCoverage">Observed property in coverage</a>].
             It is appropriate to use this for coverages also, but appropriate SKOS concepts do not always exist.
             They may need to be published along with the data proper.</p>

      <section  id="OWL-Time">
          <h3>OWL Time</h3>
          <p>Coverages should be annotated appropriately with the times observations were taken

             QB4ST does not currently define temporal terms, but is likely to in the future.
             The ontology being developed by the working group should be used.</p>
