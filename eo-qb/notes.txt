9. "QB4ST [qb4st] does not currently have a term for that, but it may in the future."

15. Example 8 led:etmBand      led:latMin led:longMax led:value are not in ANU-LED-example.ttl. They need to be (and they nee to be explained). LEd uses "bounds" instead.  Also the example seems to be outofdate wrt QB4st in the ontology?  Also it uses led:Pixel -- shouldn't it be a GridSquare (tile?). 

17. Several changes to ssn in the area of example 9. Platform, observes, onPlatform, maybe hasMeasurementCapability. Should add ssn:accuracy.

22. Example 13: check ssn:Property for change

24. Example 14. timedomain is a time:Interval that appears to be very short (begins and ends at "2001-10-26T21:32:52) . However, it is normal for satellite imagery to instead be given a (real) time period due to the  time taken to travel over the surface.  I like that the particular :grid Square has only a time instant, but surely the timedomain could be longer?
