      <p>This document advises on best practices related to the publication and usage of spatial
        data on the Web; the use of Web technologies <em>as they may be applied to location</em>.
        The best practices are intended for practitioners, including Web developers and geospatial
        experts, and are compiled based on evidence of real-world application. These best practices
        suggest a significant change of emphasis from traditional Spatial Data Infrastructures by
        adopting a Linked Data approach. As location is often the common factor across multiple
        datasets, spatial data is an especially useful addition to the Linked Data cloud; the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">5 Stars of Linked Data</a> paradigm
        is promoted where relevant.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="sotd">
      <p>In response to public comment and feedback, this draft is a substantial revision of the FPWD (changes are listed in section <a href="#changes-since-the-first-public-working-draft-of-19-january-2016"></a>). However, given that our aspiration is to provide actionable advice and guidance to practitioners (e.g. those directly publishing spatial data on the Web themselves, or those developing software tools to assist that publication) the editors recognize that there is still much to do before this best practices document is complete. Most notably, the best practices themselves (see section <a href="#bestPractices"></a>) typically lack examples to illustrate how each best practice should be applied.</p>
      
      <p>A new section (see <a href="#narrative"></a>) has also been added to introduce a coherent set of examples for publishing various types of spatial data on the Web. During the preparation of this draft, the editors intended to use this section as mechanism to help readers understand how they might apply the general best practices from [[DWBP]] and the specific best practices relating to spatial data published here to their own spatial data publication challenges. This current draft includes only the overview for each case study and does not (yet) describe the activities that each actor should undertake in order to publish their spatial data on the Web. Furthermore, given that this incomplete section is already quite lengthy, the editors recognize that this may not be the most effective method to communicate how to use the best practices. An alternative approach will be provided in the next public draft that (a) uses the flooding scenario as the basis for the examples embedded within each best practice, and (b) provides the reader with a pathway to help navigate through both sets of best practices by presenting a would-be spatial data publisher with questions they should consider and helping them to identify which best practices they should prioritize. The beginning of this “spatial data publication pathway” is presented in section <a href="#how-to-use"></a>, albeit that it is only about one-quarter complete and does not yet cover topics like the choice of data format or vocabulary. Given sufficient time and resource, the detailed case studies for the flooding scenario may be published as supporting material. Feedback on the relative merits of these approaches is requested.</p>

      <p>Looking at the current state of this document, there are a number of elements that are still missing or largely incomplete. Most notably, this includes the examples for each best practice that will illustrate the proposed approaches. These are considered crucial to help readers understand how to apply the best practices. Future drafts of this document are also likely to see: further consolidation of best practices (there is still some overlap with [[DWBP]] to be resolved), pointers to the real-world evidence where we see these best practices being applied, coherent references to the other deliverables of the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">Spatial Data on the Web working group</a> and continued editorial change.</p>

      <p>The editors would like to thank everyone for their comments and feedback on the FPWD and encourage reviewers to continue this critique.</p>

      <p><strong>For <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr>:</strong> This is a Public
        Draft of a document prepared by the Spatial Data on the Web Working Group (<a
          href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">SDWWG</a>) - a joint W3C-OGC
        project (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter">charter</a>). The document is

    </section>
    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Increasing numbers of Web applications provide a means of accessing data. From simple
        visualisations to sophisticated interactive tools, there is a growing reliance on data. The
        open data movement has lead to many national, regional and local governments publishing
        their data through portals. Scientific and cultural heritage data is increasingly published
        on the Web for reuse by others. Crowd-sourced and social media data are abundant on the Web.
        Sensors, connected devices and services from domains such as energy, transport,
        manufacturing and healthcare are becoming commonly integrated using the Web as a common data
        sharing platform.</p>
      <p>The Data on the Web Best Practices [[DWBP]] provide a set of recommendations that are
        applicable to the publication of <em>all</em> types of data on the Web. Those best practices
        cover aspects including data formats, data access, data identifiers, metadata, licensing and
        provenance.</p>
      <p>Location information, or <a>spatial data</a>, is often a common thread running through
        such data; describing how things are positioned relative to the Earth in terms of
        coordinates and/or topology.</p>
      <p>Within this document our focus is the somewhat broader concern of <a>spatial data</a>; data
        that describes <em>anything</em> with spatial extent (i.e. size, shape or position) whether
        or not it is positioned relative to the Earth.</p>
      <p>Similarly to the challenges identified in [[DWBP]] relating to publishing data on the Web,
        and therefore not making use of the full potential of the Web as a data sharing platform,
        there is a lack of consistency in how people publish <a>spatial data</a>.</p>
      <p>It is not that there is a lack of spatial data on the Web; the maps, satellite and street
        level images offered by search engines are familiar and there are many more examples of
        spatial data being used in Web applications.</p>
      <aside class="example" id="ex-sfpark" title="SFpark"><a href="http://sfpark.org/">SFpark</a>
        is a Web site where users can look at a map of San Francisco to see where parking is
        available and at what price. Parking prices are incrementally raised or lowered in SFpark
        pilot areas based on demand. In this application, static data on existing parking spaces is
        combined with changing data about where people park the most, which is measured by parking
        sensors.</aside>
      <p>However, the data that has been published is difficult to find and often problematic to
        access for non-specialist users. The key problems we are trying to solve in this document
        are discoverability, accessibility and interoperability. Our overarching goal is to enable
        spatial data to be integrated within the wider Web of data; providing standard patterns and
        solution that help solve these problems.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="audience" class="informative">
      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>Our goal in writing this best practice document is to support the practitioners who are
        responsible for publishing their spatial data on the Web or developing tools to make it easy
        for others to work with spatial data.</p>
      <p>We expect readers to be familiar both with the fundamental concepts of the architecture of
        the Web [[WEBARCH]] and the generalized best practices related to the publication and usage
        of data on the Web [[DWBP]].</p>
      <p>We aim to provide two primary pathways into these best practices:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>for those already familiar with publishing data on the Web who want to better exploit
          the spatial aspects of their data; and</li>
        <li>for those who publish spatial data through Spatial Data Infrastructures and want to
          better integrate that data within the wider Web ecosystem.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In each case, we aim to help them provide incremental value to their data through
        application of these best practices.</p>
      <p>This document provides a wide range of examples that illustrate how these best practices
        may be applied using specific technologies. We do not expect readers to be familiar with all
        the technologies used herein; rather that readers can identify with the activities being
        undertaken in the various examples and, in doing so, find relevant technologies that they
        are already aware of or discover technologies that are new them.</p>
      <p>In this document we focus on the needs of data publishers and the developers that provide
        tools for them. That said, we recognize that value can only be gained from
          <em>publishing</em> the spatial data when people <em>use</em> it! Although we do not
        directly address the needs of those users, we ask that data publishers and developers
        reading this document do not forget about them; moreover, that they always consider the
        needs of users when publishing spatial data or developing the supporting tools. All of our
        best practices are intended to provide guidance about the publishing spatial data to improve
        ease of use. As we said above: the key problems we are trying to solve in this document are
        discoverability, accessibility and interoperability. We hope that the examples included in
        the urban flooding scenario will help illustrate how users may benefit from the application
        of these best practices.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="scope" class="informative">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>All of the best practices described in [[DWBP]] are relevant to publication of spatial data
        on the Web. Some, such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#DataLicense">Provide data
          license information</a> need no further elaboration in the context of <a>spatial data</a>.
        However, other best practices from [[DWBP]] are further refined in this document to provide
        more specific guidance guidance for <a>spatial data</a>.</p>
      <p>The best practices described below are intended to meet requirements derived from the
        scenarios in [[SDW-UCR]] that describe how spatial data in commonly published and used on
        the Web.</p>
      <p>In line with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter#bp">charter</a>, this
        document provides advice on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The choice of ontology and data format to be used when encoding spatial data;</li>
        <li>The use of URIs for identifiers of resources described in spatial data;</li>
        <li>The use of metadata to complement spatial data; and</li>
        <li>The use of APIs to expose spatial data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Discussion of activities relating to rending spatial data as maps is explicitly out of
        scope.</p>
      <p>We extend [[DWBP]] to cover aspects specifically relating to <a>spatial data</a>,
        introducing new best practices only where necessary. In particular, we consider the
        individual resources, or <a>Spatial Things</a>, that are described within a dataset.</p>
      <p>We consider a ‘programmable web’, formed by a network of connected services, products, data
        and devices, each doing what it is good at, to be the future of the Web. So whether we are
        talking about Big, Crawlable, Linked, Open, Closed, Small, Spatial or Structured Data; our
        starting point is that it needs to be machine-friendly and developer-friendly: making it as
        programmable as possible.</p>
      <p>The best practices described in this document are compiled based on evidence of real-world
        application. Where the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">Working
          Group</a> have identified issues that inhibit the use or interoperability of spatial data
        on the Web, yet no evidence of real-world application is available, the editors present
        these issues to the reader for consideration, along with any approaches recommended by the
        Working Group. Such recommendations will be clearly distinguished as such in order to ensure
        that they are not confused with evidence-based best practice.</p>
      <p class="issue" data-number="81">Devise a way to make best versus emerging practices clearly
        recognizable in this document.</p>
      <p>The normative element of each best practice is the <em>intended outcome</em>. Possible
        implementations are suggested and, where appropriate, these recommend the use of a
        particular technology.</p>
      <p>An end-to-end narrative based around an urban flooding scenario is used to provide context
        for our examples. We hope that readers are able to identify with the various actors in the
        scenario, and the activities those actors are undertaking, in order to help identify which
        best practices and implementation approaches are relevant for their task.</p>
      <p>We intend this best practice to be durable; that is that the best practices remain relevant
        for many years to come as the specific technologies change. However, in order to provide
        actionable guidance, i.e. to provide readers with the technical information they need to get
        their spatial data on the Web, we try to balance between durable advice (that is necessarily
        general) and examples using currently available technologies that illustrate how these best
        practices can be implemented. We expect that readers will continue to be able to derive
        insight from the examples even when those specifically mentioned technologies are no longer
        in common usage, understanding that technology ‘y’ has replaced technology ‘x’.</p>

    <section id="spatial-things-features-and-geometry">
      <h2>Spatial Things, Features and Geometry</h2>
      <p>In spatial data standards from the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org">Open
          Geospatial Consortium</a> (OGC) and the the 19100 series of ISO geographic information
        standards from <a href="http://www.isotc211.org">ISO/TC 211</a> the primary entity is the
          <a>feature</a>. <span style="background-color:yellow">[ISO-19101]</span> defines a feature
        as an: “abstraction of real world phenomena”.</p>
      <p>This terse definition is a little confusing, so let’s unpack it.</p>
      <p>Firstly, it talks about “real world phenomena”; that’s everything from highways to
        helicopters, parking meters to postcode areas, water bodies to weather fronts and more.
        These can be physical things that you can touch (e.g. a phone box) or an abstract concept
        that has spatial extent (e.g. a postcode area). Features can even be fictional (e.g.
        “Dickensian London”) and may even lack any concrete location information such as the
        mythical Atlantis.</p>
      <p>The key point is that these “features” are things that one talks about in the <a>universe
          of discourse</a> - which is defined in <span style="background-color:yellow"
          >[ISO-19101]</span> as the “view of the real or hypothetical world that includes
        everything of interest”.</p>
      <p>Secondly, the definition of feature talks about “abstraction”. Take the example of <a
          href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q546122">Eddystone Lighthouse</a>. A helicopter pilot
        might see it a “vertical obstruction” and be interested in attributes such as its height and
        precise location. Whereas a sailor may see it as a “maritime navigation aid” and need
        information about its light characteristic and general location. Depending on one’s set of
        concerns, only a subset of the attributes of a given “real world phenomenon” are relevant.
        In the case of Eddystone Lighthouse, we defined two separate “abstractions”. As is common
        practice in many information modelling activities, the common sets of attributes for a given
        “abstraction” are used to define <em>classes</em>. In the parlance of <span
          style="background-color:yellow">[ISO-19101]</span>, such a class is known as “feature
        type”. </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Although the exact semantics differ a little, there is a good correlation between the
          concept of “feature type” as defined in spatial data standards and the concept
          of “class” defined in [[RDF-SCHEMA]]. The former is an information modelling construct that
          binds a fixed set of attributes to an identified resource, whereas the latter defines the
          set of all resources that share the same group of attributes.</p>
        <p>When combined with the <a>open-world assumption</a> embraced by RDF Schema and the Web
          Ontology Language (OWL) [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]], the set-based approach to classes provides more
          flexibility when combining information from multiple sources. For example, the “Eddystone
          Lighthouse” resource can be seen as <em>both</em> a “vertical obstruction” <em>and</em> a
          “maritime navigation aid” as it meets the criteria for membership of both sets.
          Conversely, this flexibility makes it much more difficult to build software applications
          as there is no guarantee that an information resource will specify a given attribute. Web
          standards such the Shapes Constraint Language [[SHACL]] are being defined to remedy this

      <p>However, the term “feature” is also commonly used to mean a capability of a system, application or component. Also, in some domains and/or applications no distinction is made between "<a>feature</a>" and the corresponding real-world phenomena.</p>

      <p>To avoid confusion, we adopt the term “<a>spatial thing</a>” throughout the remainder of this best practice document. “<a>Spatial thing</a>” is defined in <span style="background-color:yellow">[W3C-BASIC-GEO]</span> as “Anything with spatial extent, i.e. size, shape, or position. e.g. people, places, bowling balls, as well as abstract areas like cubes”.</p>

      <p>The concept of “<a>spatial thing</a>” is considered to include <em>both</em> "real-world phenomena" <em>and</em> their abstractions (e.g. “<a>feature</a>” as defined in <span style="background-color:yellow">[ISO-19101]</span>). Furthermore, we treat it as inclusive of other commonly used definitions; e.g. <strong>Feature</strong> from <span style="background-color:yellow">[<a href="http://geovocab.org/doc/neogeo/">NeoGeo</a>]</span>, described as “A geographical feature, capable of holding spatial relations”.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>A <a>spatial thing</a> may move. We must take care not to oversimplify our concept of <a>spatial thing</a> by assuming that it is equivalent to definitions such as <strong>Location</strong> (from [[DCTERMS]]) or <strong>Place</strong> (from <span style="background-color:yellow">[<a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>]</span>), which are respectively described as “A spatial region or named place” and "Entities that have a somewhat fixed, physical extension".</p>

      <p>Furthermore, these geometries may be subject to change due to, say, a resurvey of the

        other real world phenomena (for example, that it is located at Eddystone Rocks, Cornwall; another <a>spatial thing</a> identfied as

    <section id="coverages">
      <h2>Coverages: describing properties that vary with location (and time)</h2>
      <p>Many aspects of <a>spatial things</a> can be described with single-valued, static properties. However, in some applications it is more useful to describe the variation of property values in space and time. Such descriptions are formalized as <a>coverages</a>. Users of spatial information may employ both viewpoints.</p>

      <p>So what is a <a>coverage</a>? As defined by <span style="background-color:yellow">[ISO-19123]</span> it is simply a data structure that maps points in space and time to property values. For example, an aerial photograph can be thought of as a coverage that maps positions on the ground to colours. A river gauge maps points in time to flow values. A weather forecast maps points in space and time to values of temperature, wind speed, humidity and so forth. One way to think of a coverage is as a mathematical function, where data values are a function of coordinates in space and time.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>Sometimes you’ll hear the word “coverage” used synonymously with “gridded data” or “raster data” but this isn’t really accurate. You can see from the above paragraph that non-gridded data (like a river gauge measurement) can also be modelled as coverages. Nevertheless, you will often find a bias toward gridded data in discussions (and software) that concern coverages.</p>
      </div>

      <p>A coverage is not itself a <a>spatial thing</a>. The definition above presents a coverage as a data construct - in which case, it does not exist in the real world. Accordingly, we might say in the hydrology example, where a river gauge measures flow values at regular sampling times, that the “river segment” (a spatial thing) has a property “flow rate” that is expressed as coverage data.</p>

      <p><a>Spatial things</a> and <a>coverages</a> may be related in several ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>signals in coverages may be used to provide the evidence for the existence, location and type of spatial things; for example, within a geophysical borehole the variation in soil/rock type may be used to infer teh presence of particular rock-units at underground locations</li>
        <li>as the property value of a spatial thing whose value varies within the extent of that spatial thing; for example, the varying strength of mobile-network coverage throughout the UK</li>
        <li>the values of a common property for a distributed set of spatial things provide a discrete sampling of a coverage; for example, the measurement of soil moisture based at a set of sampling stations can be compiled to show the spatial variation of soil moisture across the region where the sampling stations are located</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A coverage can be defined using three main pieces of information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <em>domain</em> of the coverage is the set of points in space and time for which we have data values. For example, in a river gauge measurement, the domain is the set of times at which the flow was measured. In a satellite image, the domain is the set of pixels. In a weather forecast, the domain is a set of grid cells.</li>
        <li>The <em>range</em> of the coverage is the set of measured, simulated or observed data values. A single coverage may record values for lots of different quantities; for example a weather forecast predicts values for many things (temperature, humidity etc) on the same domain. So the range of a coverage often consists of a number of lists of data values, one for each measured variable. Each element within each list corresponds with one of the elements of the domain (e.g. a pixel or grid cell).</li>
        <li>The <em>range metadata</em> describes the range of the coverage, to help users to understand what the data values mean. This may include links to definitions of variables, units of measure and other bits of useful information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Usually, the most complex piece of information in the coverage is the definition of the domain. This can vary quite widely from coverage type to coverage type, as the list above shows. For this reason, coverages are often defined by the spatiotemporal geometry of their domain. You will hear people talking about “multidimensional grid coverages” or “timeseries coverages” or “vertical profile coverages” for example.</p>

      <h2>Spatial relations</h2>
      <p>A spatial relation specifies how an object is located in space in relation to a reference
        object. Commonly used types of spatial relations are: topological, directional and distance
        relations.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Topological relations</em> describe the relationships between geometric objects that
          are invariant to rotation, translation and scaling. As such, topological relations can
          support qualitative spatial reasoning without reference to the geometries themselves; for
          example to assert that object A touches object B. These relations, also known as “spatial
          predicates”, include concepts such as: equals, disjoint, intersects, touches, within,
          contains, overlaps and crosses.</li>
        <li><em>Directional relations</em> specify the relative direction between object and
          reference. Examples include: left, in front of and astern.</li>
        <li><em>Distance relations</em> specify how far the object is from the reference object.

    <section id="linked-data">
      <h2>Linked Data</h2>
      <p>The term ‘<a>Linked Data</a>’ refers to an approach to publishing data that puts linking at
        the heart of the notion of data, and uses the linking technologies provided by the Web to
        enable the weaving of a global distributed database. By naming real world entities - be they
        web resources, physical objects such as the Eiffel Tower, or even more abstract things such
        as relations or concepts - with URLs data can be published and linked in the same way web
        pages can. [[LDP-PRIMER]]</p>
      <p>The 5-star scheme at <span style="background-color:yellow">[<a href="http://5stardata.info"
            >5STARDATA</a>]</span> states:</p>
      <p style="text-indent:80px">&#9733; make your stuff available on the Web (whatever format)
        under an open license</p>
      <p style="text-indent:65px">&#9733;&#9733; make it available as structured data (e.g., Excel
        instead of image scan of a table)</p>
      <p style="text-indent:50px">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; make it available in a non-proprietary open

        to provide context</p>
      <p>We think that the concept of <a>Linked Data</a> is fundamental to the publishing of spatial
        data on the Web: it is the <a>links</a> that connect data together that are the foundational
        to the Web of data.</p>
      <p>In a departure from the approach adopted within typical <a>spatial data
        infrastructures</a>, these best practices promote a Linked Data approach.</p>
      <p>Sources such as the Best Practices for Publishing Linked Data [[LD-BP]] assert a strong
        association between Linked Data and the <a>Resource Description Framework</a> (RDF)
        [[RDF11-PRIMER]]. Yet we believe that Linked Data requires only that the formats used to
        publish data support Web linking (see [[WEBARCH]] <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#hypertext">§4.4 Hypertext</a>). <span
          style="background-color:yellow">[<a href="http://5stardata.info">5STARDATA</a>]</span>
        asserts only that data formats be open and non-proprietary (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;); and
        infers the need for data formats to support use of URIs as identifiers
        (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;) and Web linking (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;).</p>
      <p>Within this document we include examples that use <a>RDF</a> and related technologies such
        as <a>triple stores</a> and <a>SPARQL</a> because we see evidence of its use in real world
        applications that support <a>Linked Data</a>. However, we must make clear to readers that
        there is no requirement for all publishers of spatial data on the Web to embrace the wider
        suite of technologies associated with the Semantic Web; we recognize that in many cases, a
        Web developer has little or no interest in the toolchains associated with Semantic Web due
        to the addition of complexity to any Web-centric solution.</p>
      <p>Although we think that <a>Linked Data</a> need not necessarily require the use of
          <a>RDF</a>, it is probably easiest to do so. We note that [[JSON-LD]] provides a bridge
        between those worlds by providing a data format that is compatible with RDF but relies on
        standard <a>JSON</a> tooling.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, as the examples in this document illustrate, we often see a ‘hybrid’ approach
        being used in real-world applications; using <a>RDF</a> to work with graphs of information
        that interlink resources, while relying on other technologies to query and process the
        spatial aspects of that information for performance reasons.</p>

      <h2>Why are traditional Spatial Data Infrastructures not enough?</h2>
      <p>Finding, accessing and using data disseminated through <a>spatial data infrastructures</a>
        (SDI) based on <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> web services is difficult
        for non-expert users. There are several reasons, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In <a>spatial data infrastructures</a>, catalog services are intended to be used for
          discovering spatial assets, not the general purpose search engines of the Web. <abbr
            title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr> web services do not address indexing of
          their content by those search engines.</li>
        <li>By design, the catalog services only provide access to metadata - and in general
          metadata that is focussed on the needs of expert users - not the data itself.</li>
        <li>Users cannot just “follow links” to access data, it is typically necessary to construct
          some kind of query to access data. Often these queries are complex to define, requiring in
          depth knowledge both of the data structure and the domain-specific query language.</li>
        <li>In addition, it is often difficult for non-expert users to understand and use the data.
          Part of this are domain-specific complexities that are difficult for non-experts (e.g.,
          handling of coordinates in different coordinate reference systems), but hard to avoid
          entirely. But the datasets often address requirements of expert communities with diverse
          needs, resulting in comprehensive, but complex specifications that cover many edge cases,
          too. And the data is typically available in formats that are not easy to process for
          non-expert users.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, <a>spatial data infrastructures</a> are a key component of the broader <a>spatial
          data</a> ecosystem. Such infrastructures typically include workflows and tools related to
        the management and curation of spatial datasets, and provide mechanism to support the rich
        set of capabilities required by the expert community. Our goal is to help spatial data
        publishers build on these foundations to enable the spatial data from SDIs to be fully
        integrated with the Web of data.</p>

      <section id="starting-points">
        <h3>What are the starting points?</h3>
        <p>Preparations for publishing spatial data on the Web need to start somewhere. Typically, your spatial data will be in the following places:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>plain text documents; e.g. historical texts, government reports, blog posts etc.</li>
          <li>data files containing structured content or markup; e.g. geospatial vector data in Shapefile or GML format, statistical data in tabular CSV format or a spreadsheet, as GPX data with “waypoints” and “tracks”, satellite imagery in GeoTIFF, climate simulations in CF-NetCDF etc.</li>
          <li>a data repository; e.g. PostGIS (a spatially enabled relational database), Elasticsearch (a document-oriented noSQL repository based on Apache Lucene), Apache Jena’s TDB (an RDF triple store)</li>
          <li>exposed via an existing API; including OGC-compliant web services such as WFS and WCS</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If your spatial data is managed within a software system it is likely that you will be able to access that data through one or more of the methods identified above; as structured data from a bulk extract (e.g. a “data dump”), via direct access to the underpinning data repository or through a bespoke or standards-compliant API provided by the system.</p>
        <p>As working with specific spatial data management systems is beyond the scope of this best practice document we will assume that one of the four methods identified above is your starting point.</p>
        <p>Each of these starting points have their own challenges, but working with plain text documents can be particularly tricky as you will need to parse the natural language to identify the spatial things and their properties before you can proceed any further. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is also beyond the scope of this best practice document - so we will assume that you’ve already completed this step and have parsed any plain documents into structured data records of some kind.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="what-r-u-talking-about">
        <h3>What are you talking about?</h3>
        <p>The Web is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by URIs ([[WEBARCH]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#intro">§1. Introduction</a>). The spatial data you want to publish is one such <strong>resource</strong>. Depending on the nature of your spatial data, it may be a single <strong>dataset</strong> or a collection of datasets. [[vocab-dcat]] provides a useful definition of dataset: “A collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more formats.”</p>

        <p>Deciding whether your spatial data is a single dataset or not is somewhat arbitrary. That said, it is often useful to consider attributes such as the license under which the data will be made available, the refresh or publication schedules, the quality of the data and the governance regime applied in managing the data. Typically, all of these attributes should be consistent within a single dataset.</p>

        <p>As a first step in publishing your spatial data on the Web, we need to stitch your data into the Web’s information space by assigning a URI to each dataset (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#UniqueIdentifiers">Best Practice 9: “Use persistent URIs as identifiers of datasets”</a>). Furthermore, if you anticipate your data changing over time and you want users to to be able to refer to a particular version of your dataset you should also consider assigning a URI to each version of the dataset (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#VersionIdentifiers">Best Practice 11: “Assign URIs to dataset versions and series”</a>).</p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#dataVersioning">§8.6 “Data Versioning”</a> provides further guidance on working with versioned resources: providing metadata to indicate the particular version of a given dataset resource (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#VersioningInfo">Best Practice 7: “Provide a version indicator”</a>) and enabling users to browse the history of your dataset (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#VersionHistory">Best Practice 8: “Provide version history”</a>).</p>
        </div>

        <p>We also need to look inside the datasets at the resources described within your data. If you want these resources to be visible within the Web’s information space, by which we mean that others can refer to or talk about those resources, then they must also be assigned URIs (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#identifiersWithinDatasets">Best Practice 10: “Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets”</a>). These URIs are like 'Web-scale foreign keys' that enable information from different sources to be stitched together.</p>

        <p>In spatial data, our primary concern is always the spatial things; these are the things with spatial extent (i.e. size, shape, or position) that we talk about in our data - anything from physical things like people, places and post boxes to abstractions such as administrative areas. Spatial things should always be assigned URIs (see <a href="#globally-unique-ids">Best Practice 7: “Use globally unique HTTP identifiers for spatial things”</a>) - potentially reusing existing URIs that are already in common usage. A common pattern used when assigning URIs to spatial things is append the locally-scoped identifiers used within the dataset to a URI path within an internet DNS domain where one has administrative rights to publish content.</p>

        <p>Depending on how you organize your data, it may also be helpful to give your geometry objects URIs. For example, you may want to reuse a line string when describing the boundaries of adjacent administrative areas, or you may need to serve geometry data from an alternate URL because property data and geometry data are managed in different systems. Essentially, if you want to refer to a resource on the Web, you need to assign a URI to it.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="who-is-your-audience">
        <h3>Who is your audience?</h3>
        <p>Once you have determined the subjects of your spatial data, you should then consider your users - and the software tools, applications and capabilities they might have at their disposal.</p>

        <p>Your objective should be to reduce the “friction” created for users to work with your data by providing it in a form that is closest to what their chosen software environment supports.</p>

        <p>It is likely that you will be able to identify your intended “community of use” - and on that basis discern how best to publish data for them. However, increasingly data is being repurposed to derive insight in ways that the original publisher had never foreseen. This “unanticipated re-use” can add significant value to your data (e.g. because you didn’t know that your data could be used that way!) but this introduces the challenge of working with a large set of unknown users, developers and devices.</p>

        <p>So while you should always prioritize your known users when publishing spatial data on the Web (often, because they are your stakeholders and their happiness can lead to continued funding!), it will often reap dividends to “design for the masses”: providing your spatial data in a way that is most readily usable with the (geo)spatial Javascript libraries commonly employed across the Web.</p>

        <p>Things that you should consider when choosing how to publish your spatial data on the Web are described next …</p>
      </section>
      <section id="parse-that">
        <h3>Parse that!</h3>
        <p>For users to work with your data, software agents (a.k.a. the “machines”) need to be able to parse it - to resolve the serialized data into its component parts. You should make your data available in machine-readable, standardized data formats (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#MachineReadableStandardizedFormat">Best Practice 12: “Use machine-readable standardized data formats”</a>); e.g. JSON [[RFC7159]], XML [[XML11]], CSV [[RFC4180]] and other tabular data formats, YAML <span style="background-color:yellow">[<a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html">YAML12</a>]</span>, protocol-buffers <span style="background-color:yellow">[<a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/proto3-spec">PROTO3</a>]</span> etc. According to the <span style="background-color:yellow">[<a href="http://5stardata.info">5STARDATA</a>]</span> scheme, using open and non-proprietary structured data formats yields a 3-star rating (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;), so you’re well on your way to good practice.</p>

        <p>Consider that Web applications are most often written in Javascript, probably the most “frictionless” data format for Web developers is JSON. That said, it is reasonably simple to parse other formats for use in Javascript using widely available libraries. In some cases, there are even standards to define how this should be done (for example: [[CSV2JSON]])</p>

        <p>You should also consider whether there are any attributes of these machine-readable standardized data formats that offset a little inconvenience for your data user. For example, protocol-buffers <span style="background-color:yellow">[<a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/proto3-spec">PROTO3</a>]</span> and CBOR [[RFC7049]] (“Concise Binary Object Representation”) provide a significantly more compact encoding that JSON. The inconvenience of having to use additional libraries to parse these binary formats is offset by the convenience of much faster load times.</p>

        <p>Imagery formats <span style="background-color:yellow">[JPEG]</span> and <span style="background-color:yellow">[PNG]</span> can also be coerced to carry data; providing 3 or 4 channels of 8-bit data values. This can be an attractive way to encode gridded coverage data values as it is highly compact. So long as you don’t apply compression algorithms to the “image”; while compression retains visual integrity, it can ruin your data integrity. Experience indicates that network providers often do apply compression to image formats - even if you don’t want that. The key point is to ensure that you choose formats that are unaffected by the transport network.</p>

        <p>When selecting the data format, make sure that your community of use have access to libraries or other software components required to work with that format. Let’s take <span style="background-color:yellow">[GeoTIFF]</span> as an “anti-example”: it’s the de facto format for encoding geo-referenced imagery data - such as that available from satellites - but the lack of widely available libraries for working with it in a Javascript application make it unsuitable for publishing spatial data on the Web. Although a developer could write a byte-level parser, it puts an additional burden on any re-use.</p>

        <h3>Spatial Metadata</h3>
        <p>[[DWBP]] provides best practices discussing the provision of metadata to support
          discovery and reuse of data (see [[DWBP]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#metadata"
            >Metadata</a> for more details). Providing metadata at the <em>dataset</em> level
          supports a mode of discovery well aligned with the practices used in <a>Spatial Data
            Infrastructure</a> (SDI) where a user begins their search for spatial data by submitting
          a query to a catalog. Once the appropriate dataset has been located, the information
          provided by the catalog enables the user to find a service end-point from which to access
          the data itself - which may be as simple as providing a mechanism to download the entire
          dataset for local usage or may provide a rich API enabling the users to request only the
          required parts for their needs. The dataset-level metadata is used by the catalog to match
          the appropriate dataset(s) with the user's query.</p>
        <p>This section includes best practices for including the spatial extent and the CRS of the
          dataset in the metadata. These are the extra metadata items needed to make spatial
          datasets discoverable and reusable. A third best practice in this section helps you go a
          step further: exposing spatial data on the web in such a way that the individual entities
          within the dataset are discoverable. </p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>For spatial data, it is often necessary to describe the spatial details of the
              dataset - such as spatial coverage or extent of the dataset or, put in simpler terms,
              which area of the world the data is about. This information is used, for example, by
                <a>SDI</a> catalog services that offer spatial querying to find data - but also by
              users to understand the nature of the dataset.</p>

          <section class="outcome">
            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>Dataset metadata should include the information necessary to enable spatial queries
              within catalog services such as those provided by <a>SDIs</a>.</p>
            <p>Dataset metadata should include the information required for a user to evaluate
              whether the spatial data is suitable for their intented application.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>Provide as much spatial metadata as necessary, but at least the spatial coverage.
              Other examples of spatial metadata are: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>number of dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D)</li>
              <li>spatial representation type (e.g. grid, vector, text table)</li>
              <li>positioning system used for acquiring location</li>
              <li>Coordinate Reference System(s) - see <a href="#ref-crs" class="sectionRef">BP2</a></li>
              <li>spatial resolution - <a href="#desc-accuracy" class="sectionRef">see BP5</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>In Spatial Data Infrastructures the accepted standard for describing metadata is
              [[ISO19115]]. </p>
            <p>To provide information about the spatial attributes of the dataset on the web one
              can: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>As shown in [[DWBP]] best practice <a
                  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#DescriptiveMetadata">Descriptive Metadata</a>:
                Include the spatial coverage of the features described by the dataset using
                [[vocab-dcat]] and a reference to a named place in a common vocabulary for
                geospatial semantics (e.g. <a
                  href="http://www.geonames.org/ontology/documentation.html">GeoNames</a>), </li>
              <li>Again, use [[vocab-dcat]], but instead of a reference to a named place, use a set
                of coordinates to specify the boundaries of the area either as a bounding box (add
                glossary ref) or a polygon.</li>
              <li>Use the spatial extension of [[vocab-dcat]], [[GeoDCAT-AP]], to specify spatial
                attributes that are not available in [[vocab-dcat]]. GeoDCAT-AP provides an RDF
                syntax binding for the metadata elements defined in the core profile of [[ISO19115]]
                and in the INSPIRE metadata schema [[INSPIRE-MD]].</li>

          <h4>Coordinate Reference System (CRS)</h4>
          <p>A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) defines a local, regional or global coordinate system that can be used to locate spatial entities. CRS can provide a map projection and also define the transformations between different spatial reference systems. CRS’s can be referred to by using a SRID integer, including EPSG codes defined by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers.  Most of the spatial vendors create their own SRID implementation or refer to an authority such as the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system">more information</a>).</p>

           <p> A list of CRS’s maintained by IGN-France (in RDF format) can be also found <a href="http://yasgui.org/short/rJIItc2d">here</a>. The list is published according to the vocab at: <a href="http://data.ign.fr/def/ignf/20160628.ttl">http://data.ign.fr/def/ignf/20160628.ttl</a>.</p>

            <p>The spatial data is usually shared and communicated through the use of common standards between different communities. Since there are several standards and different ways to represent spatial data, each community structures the spatial data according to their standards and their own domain of interest. This heterogeneity and variety of standards and reference systems as well as different data formats and structures can hinder sharing and exchanging the spatial data. This requires defining best practices to represent information regarding the coordinate systems and also providing APIs that can make the transformation between different systems and standards. For example Apache SIS® provides a common programming interface (API) to ensure the interoperability of data across different coordinate systems [<a href="http://sis.staging.apache.org/book/en/developer-guide.html">Ref</a>]. </p>

           <p> Many applications usually provide/use latitude and longitude, but often forget about the third dimension (ellipsoidal height). When converting between CRSs that use different datums, the third dimension is also needed. EPSG guidelines say that, if the height is missing, reasonable assumptions are: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Height = 0 (i.e. we are standing on the surface of the ellipsoid)</li>
  <li>The height is given by a digital elevation model (i.e. we are standing on the surface of the planet)</li>
</ol>

           <p>These two assumptions will lead to different answers for *all three* coordinates in a “new” system (and both assumptions might be wrong). This could be important on the Web, because we frequently give latitude and longitude, but no information about ellipsoidal height is often provided. This means that if we convert these coordinates into a new system, we will get an uncertain position (and even the horizontal positions in the new system are uncertain, not just the height) [For more information refere to the discussion <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sdw-wg/2016Aug/0051.html">here</a>]. </p>

<p>The process of converting coordinates between CRSs that use different datums can be also very involved.</p>

<h4>Choosing a CRS (By: Byron Cochrane- <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sdw-wg/2016Aug/0022.html">link)</a> </h4>

<p>By default, most vector data should be shared in un-projected geographic coordinates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">WGS 84</a>– <a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/">SRID 4326</a>. Raster data, which is already projected by the nature of the format, should be shared by default in web Mercator-SRID 3857. </p>


<h5>Considering the audience</h5>

<p>As a Publisher one can make decisions on behalf of the users.  Who are the primary and secondary users?  Target those whose requirements match the data.
Is the primary audience is known and work within a limited well defined spatial extent, of say an urban region?  Then it is likely that there is a local projected CRS by which data is commonly shared in that region.  Share the data in this projection.  Consider sharing the data in more than one projection.</p>

<p>Listen to the customers:  Metadata should provide contacts to publishers.  Encourage feedback particularly for new secondary users. This feedback may give insight to projections you should support.</p>
<p>[Web accessibility guidelines - ??] </p>


<h5>Consider the Data</h5>

<p>Vector data is quite easy for web mapping tools to project from geographic coordinates.  Raster data requires much more intensive computation for this task.  Raster is commonly published in a projected CRS instead of geographic coordinates.  Raster data should be published in the CRS in which it was produced and if possible and useful, also in web Mercator.</p>

<h5> Consider the Use </h5>

<p>The seemingly multitude of CRS’s exist because of different requirements.  Some projections are better for measuring area, some are better for measure distance, some are better for measuring angles, some simply look better when displayed and make for a better user interface. </p>

          <p>Are the aesthetic and readability issues associated with the data?  What projections display the data to best convey the most information you wish to share? Which way is north is effected by the projection chosen.  Spatial data often are used to provide user interface via a map.  Some map projections may support this use better than others.While it is likely true that the majority of users may be satisfied with WGS 84 and Web Mercator, the most value may be gained by those users requiring other projections.</p>


<h5>Consider how the data is distributed </h5>

<p>Different requirements may occur if the data is downloaded as a whole dataset or accessed via a web service [needs more clarification...] </p>

          <p class="practicedesc">A coordinate referencing system (CRS) should be specified for
            high-precision applications to locate geospatial entities.</p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>The <a>CRS</a> is a special metadata attribute of spatial data that must be known for
              users to judge if the data is usable to them. Clients or users must always be able to
              determine what CRS is used. Sometimes the CRS is left implicit: it is then determined by the specification of the data format that is used. Preferably, the CRS is specified at least as part of the metadata so that
              clients and users can judge if the data is usable, and can find spatial
              data with a specific CRS. </p>
            <p>The choice of CRS is sensitive to the intended domain of application for the
              spatial data. For the majority of applications a common global CRS (WGS84) is fine,
              but high precision applications (such as precision agriculture and defence) require
              spatial referencing to be accurate to a few meters or even centimeters. Specific,
              highly accurate CRS exist to provide a coordinate system for a specific region of the
              world (often a specific country). Spatial data from France is never going to use the
              Dutch coordinate system and vice versa.</p>
            <p>Different <a>CRS</a> exist mainly because the positions on the surface of the earth
              relative to each other are constantly changing. For example, North America and Europe
              are receding from each other by a couple of centimeters per year, whereas Australia is
              moving several centimeters per year north-eastwards. So, for better than one meter
              accuracy in Europe, the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) was
              devised and it is frequently revised to take account of the drifting European tectonic
              plate. Consequently, coordinates in the ETRS89 system will change by a couple of
              centimetres per year with respect to WGS84.</p>
            <p>Even if a <a>CRS</a>, tied to a tectonic plate, is used, local coordinates in some
              areas may still change over time, if the plate is rotating with respect to the rest of
              the earth. Many existing useful maps pre-date GPS and WGS84 based mapping, so that
              location errors of tens of metres, or more, may exist when compared to the same
              location derived from a different technology, and these errors may vary in size across
              the extent of a single map.</p>
            <p>Another reason why different CRS exist has nothing to do with tectonic drift, but
              with projecting the 3D globe on a flat, 2D map: Cartesian projections. These are
              useful e.g. for calculating areas. </p>
            <p class="note">The misuse of spatial data, because of confusion about the CRS, can
              result in catastrophic results; e.g. both the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
              Belgrade during the Balkan conflict and fatal incidents along the East Timor border
              are generally attributed to spatial referencing problems.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>Recommendations about CRS referencing should consider:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If your goal is to make data available to mass-market web users, make it available
                in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">WGS84</a>. This CRS
                is suitable for many applications, but be aware (and perhaps publish) the
                limitations of doing so.</li>
              <li>If your goal is high accuracy, choose the best local CRS for your data.</li>
              <li>Publishing data in multiple CRSs is fine, and may help users to combine your data
                with other sources, as well as serving multiple types of user.</li>
              <li>It is preferable to explicitly state which CRS(s) you are using. For convenience,
                the CRS is often designated within the data format or vocabulary specification (e.g.
                  <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos">W3C WGS84 Geo Positioning
                  vocabulary</a>) and, therefore, does not appear in the data itself. This is often
                considered as a default CRS. Data publishers and consumers should make sure they are
                aware of the specified CRS and any limitations that this may pose regarding the use
                of the data.</li>
              <li>Where a specific CRS is required, the data publisher should choose a vocabulary
                where the CRS can be defined explicitly within the data.</li>
            </ul>

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>This best practice goes one step beyond providing metadata as an way to make datasets
              discoverable. Current <a>SDI</a> approaches require a 2-step approach for discovery,
              beginning with a catalog query and then accessing the appropriate data service
              end-point. However, one of the criteria for exposing data <em>on the Web</em> is that
              it can be discovered directly using search engines such as <a
                href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.bing.com/">Bing</a>
              and <a href="https://www.yandex.com/">Yandex</a>, or other services such as
              ‘sameAs.org’ (which harvests links) and HyperCat. Current <a>SDI</a> approaches treat
              spatial data much like books in a library where you must first use the librarian's
              card catalog index to find the book on the shelf. As for other types of data on the
              Web, we want to be able to find spatial resources directly; we want to move beyond the
              two-step discovery approach of contemporary <a>SDIs</a> and find the words, sentences
              and chapters in a book without needing to check the card catalog first. Not only will
              this make spatial data far more accessible, it mitigates the problems caused when
              catalogs have only stale dataset metadata and removes the need for data users to be
              proficient with the query protocol of the dataset's service end-point in order to
              acquire the data they need.</p>
            <p>Exposing data <em>on the Web</em> means that it can be discovered directly using
              search engines. This doesn't mean metadata is no longer necessary; it is still needed
              for clients and users to judge the usability of the data for their purposes. Both
              metadata and data should be exposed in a discoverable way on the web. This provides a
              number of benefits:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Spatial data will become far more discoverable because a user does not need any
                special knowledge to find the <a>SDIs</a> catalog service.</li>
              <li>Users can discover what data is <em>actually</em> available, rather than relying
                on the metadata that is infrequently published to the catalog and may have become
                stale.</li>
              <li>Users do not need to be proficient with the query protocol of the dataset's
                service end-point in order to acquire the data they need.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Search engines should be able to use links and URIs to discover indexable spatial
              data and to prioritize those spatial data collections within a search result.</p>
            <p>Search engines use links to discover content to index and to prioritize that content
              within a search result.</p>

            <p>Spatial metadata and data is indexable by search engines; a search engine Web crawler

              <li>Generate one HTML page per resource - one page for the metadata record and one
                page for each entity in the dataset. Include structured markup (see <a
                  href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>) that the search engines can use to make
                more detailed assumptions about your resource(s) and drive better search
                performance. Either create pages beforehand or generate them at query time via an
                API.</li>
              <li>Provide a path for search engines to find your pages - either crawling to each
                entity from a 'collection' object (which provides the entry point for the web
                crawler) or being directed by <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/">sitemaps</a>.</li>
              <li>Search engines may be used to search spatial data based on identifier, location,
                time, etc (some examples are provided in [<a
                  href="http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/P.Barnaghi/doc/semantic_stream_iThings2013_167.pdf"
                  >Section III.A, Barnaghi et al.</a>]. The search for spatial data can be similar
                to the typical search query, but the search and use of results in many cases will be
                done by software agents and other services like <a
                  href="https://www.google.co.uk/landing/now/">Google Now</a> that interpret

            <p class="note">As more spatial datasets are published that provide structured markup to

        <h3>Spatial Data Quality</h3>
        <p>[[DWBP]] provides a best practice discussing how the quality of data on the web should be
          described (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#quality">Data Quality</a> for
          more details). This section is based on the Data Quality section from [[DWBP]] and adds a
          Best Practice specific for spatial data.</p>
        <p>In the Spatial Metadata section we provided a <a href="#ref-crs" class="sectionRef">Best Practice</a> on how
          to deal with CRS in spatial data on the web. There is also a clear link between CRS and
          data quality, because the accuracy of spatial data depends for a large part on the CRS
          used. This can be seen as conformance of data with a "standard" - in this case, a (spatial
          or temporal) reference system. This is how you can describe spatial data quality using
          different vocabularies. We will provide an example in this section. </p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>The amount of detail that is provided in spatial data and the resolution of the data
              can vary. No measurement system is infinitely precise and in some cases the spatial
              data can be intentionally generalized (e.g. merging entities, reducing the details,
              and aggregation of the data) [[Veregin]].</p>
            <p class="note">It is important to understand the difference between precision and
              accuracy. Seven decimal places of a latitude degree corresponds to about one
              centimeter. Whatever the precision of the specified coordinates, the accuracy of
              positioning on the actual earth's surface using WGS84 will only approach about a metre
              horizontally and may have apparent errors of up to 100 metres vertically, because of
              assumptions about reference systems, tectonic plate movements and which definition of
              the earth's 'surface' is used.</p>

          <section class="outcome">
            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>When known, the resolution and precision of spatial data should be specified in a way
              to allow consumers of the data to be aware of the resolution and level of details that

        <h3>Spatial Data Versioning</h3>
        <p>Spatial dataset, like most datasets, can change over time. When this happens a new
          version may be published on the Web. The best practices for dataset versioning described
          in the [[DWBP]] section on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#dataVersioning">Data
            Versioning</a> apply to spatial datasets as well.</p>
        <p>Entities and their properties within datasets can change over time and this change can be
          related to spatial properties, for example when a spatial thing moves from one location to
          another location, or when it becomes bigger or smaller. </p>
        <p class="note">This section is based on the Data Versioning section from [[DWBP]] and adds
          a Best Practice specific for spatial data. This is about versioning on the property level,
          while the DWBP is concerned with the dataset level. </p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>For some use cases you need to be able to explicitly refer to a particular version of
              information that describes a <a>SpatialThing</a>, or to infer which geometry is
              appropriate at a specific time, based on the versioning. To make this possible, the
              properties that are described for an entity should have references to the time and
              location that the information describing a <a>SpatialThing</a> was captured and should
              retain a version history. This allows you to reference the most recent data as well as
              previous versions and to also follow the changes of the properties. </p>

            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>By default, data users are provided with the most recent version of information about
              an identified resource.</p>
            <p>Data users are able to refer to the information about an identified resource as
              it was at a given time.</p>
            <p>Data users can browse through versions of the information about an identified
              resource that reflect how the resource changed over time.</p>

              approach (ignoring the change aspects) is appropriate</p>
            <p>When entities and their properties can change over time, or are valid only at a given
              time, and this needs to be captured, it is important to specify a clear relationship
              between property data and its versioning information. How properties are versioned
              should be explained in the specification or schema that defines those properties.
              Temporal and/or spatial metadata should be provided to indicate when and where the
              information about the <a>SpatialThing</a> was captured. </p>

            <p>It is also useful to incorporate information on how often the information might
              change, i.e. the frequency of update.</p>
            <p>Data publishers must decide how much change is acceptable before a
                <a>SpatialThing</a> cannot be considered equivalent. At this point, a new identifier
              should be used as the subject for all properties about the changed

        <h3>Spatial Data Identifiers</h3>
        <p>As explained in <a href="#spatial-things-features-and-geometry" class="sectionRef">Section 4</a>, spatial things and geometries are different things, the geometries being properties of spatial things. One spatial thing could have several geometries, each giving a different representation of the thing. In general, there could be several information resources, in different datasets, that describe or refer to the same spatial thing; for example, one dataset has its location (as a point geometry) and date a lighthouse was built, another has data about its ownership or about shipwrecks near the same lighthouse. A third has a 3D representation of the lighthouse.</p>
        <p>The distinction between spatial things and the information resources that describe them is often confusing and unhelpful. Mostly, people looking for information are interested in spatial things, not in information resources. Therefore the spatial things should get global identifiers so
          they can be found and referenced. The geometries should have global identifiers too so they can be referenced and reused; and
          must have them if they are managed elsewhere. The information resources could be given identifiers of their own when there's a specific reason to identify them separately.</p>
        <p>[[DWBP]] provides best practices discussing globally unique identifiers and the use of HTTP (or  HTTPS) URIs for these identifers in order to support data discovery, usage and citation on the Web (see [[DWBP]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#DataIdentifiers"
          >Data Identifiers</a> for more details). This section includes a best practice on how to come up with good identifiers for spatial data.</p>
        <div class="issue" data-number="208">
          <p>There's still an open issue about identifier assignment. Do we recommend to assign different identifiers to spatial things and to information resources about those things? We seem to be close to consensus: use of the same identifier for both i.e. using the information resource identifier as indirect identifier for the spatial thing, is ok. Metadata about the information resource goes in the metadata.</p>

          <p class="practicedesc">Spatial things referred to within datasets SHOULD have unique, persistent HTTP or

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>A lot of spatial data is available 'via the Web' - but not really 'on the web': you
              can download datasets, or view, query and download data via web services, but it has not been so easy to reference a spatial thing within a dataset, like you would a web
              page, because the spatial things themselves don't have URIs. If they did, spatial data would be much easier to reuse and to
              integrate with other data on the Web.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>Spatial things described or mentioned in a dataset will each be identified using
              a globally unique HTTP URI so that a given spatial thing can be unambiguously identified in
              statements that refer to that spatial thing.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>Good identifiers for data on the Web should be dereferenceable/resolvable, which
              makes it a good idea to use HTTP URIs as identifiers. As explained in [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#identifiersWithinDatasets"
                >Best Practice 11: Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets</a>, it is best to reuse existing (authoritative) identifiers when available, or else create your own. </p>
            <p>1. Reuse identifiers when you can</p>
            <p>For spatial data, a good approach for identifiers is to reuse the URIs used by organizations such as <a href="http://dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a> and
                <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">GeoNames</a> to identify <a>SpatialThings</a>. These are
              commonly used across many different applications and datasets. Public government data, such as national registers of addresses, buildings, and so on, are another good source of resource collections. Mapping and cadastral
              authorities maintain datasets that provide geospatial reference data. See also Appendix <a href="#auth-id-sources" class="sectionRef">B. Authoritative sources of geographic identifiers</a> for a list of good sources of geographic identifiers. In general, re-using
                well-known identifiers such as these is good practice because it makes it easy to
                recognize that data from different sources has the same subject. These identifiers are like
                'Web-scale foreign keys', allowing information from different sources to be stitched
                together.</p>
            <p>Additionally, when these authoritative identifiers are resolved, a considerable
              amount of useful information about the <a>SpatialThing</a> is often provided that can
              be used to supplement that which is provided by your own application. Examples include
              place names in multiple languages and geographic boundaries.</p>
            <p class="note">Where you are not able to re-use an existing URI, you should link the
              your URI to those well-known URIs published by third parties, thus enabling your data
              to be discovered by browsing between related resources. See <a
                href="#link-to-auth-identifiers">Best Practice 20: Link to resources with well-known
                or authoritative identifiers</a> for more information.</p>
            <p>2. When there are no reusable identifiers, create your own</p>
            <p>For guidance about persistent URIs when creating your own URIs, read [[DWBP]] <a
                href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#UniqueIdentifiers">Best Practice 10: Use persistent
                URIs as identifiers of datasets</a>. While that best practice is about datasets, many of the points are valid for identifiers of spatial things as well. Keep in mind not to use service endpoint URLs as a basis for your persistent URIs, as these are
              usually dependent on technology, implementation, and/or API version and will probably
              change when the implementation changes.</p>
            <p>Often, dataset-scoped (local) identifiers are present in datasets and these can be converted or mapped to URIs for spatial things. For example, use row numbers from tabular data or record identifiers from geo-databases.</p>
            <p class="issue" data-number="358">Should we describe a practice of identifiers being structured minimally at least for purposes of authority and uniqueness? And when to consider taxonomic meaning for primary or secondary identifiers.</p>
            <p>3. Provide stable identifiers for spatial things that change over time</p>
            <p>Spatial things can change over time, but their
              identifiers should be persistent so that links to them don't get broken. </p>
            <p class="issue" data-number="194">Should we reference the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">paradox of the Ship of
              Theseus</a> to highlight there is no rigorous notion of persistent identity? - or is it just that there is no <em>single</em> notion. </p>
            <p>[[DWBP]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#VersioningInfo">Best Practice 8: Provide a version indicator</a> explains how to provide versioning information for datasets. It
              doesn't provide information about versioning individual things. </p>
            <p>Spatial things can change in different ways, and sometimes the change is such that
              it's debatable if it's still the same thing. Think carefully about the life cycle of
              the spatial things in your care, whether the changes matter for the application, and be reluctant to assign new identifiers. A lake
              that becomes smaller or bigger is generally still the same lake, but some links (e.g.
              from statistical datasets, or related to the boundary of the lake) need to target a
              specific version of its geometry.</p>
            <p>Include information in your dataset that indicates when the statements made about the
              <a>SpatialThing</a> are valid.</p>
            <p>If your spatial things are versioned, a good solution is to provide a canonical,
              versionless URI for them, as well as date-stamped versions. You should also
              include information on the update frequency in the dataset metadata (see [[DWBP]] <a
                href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#DescriptiveMetadata">Best Practice 2: Provide descriptive metadata</a>).</p>

        <h3>Spatial Data Vocabularies</h3>
        <p>In this document there is no section on formats for publishing spatial data on the web. The formats are basically the same as for publishing any other data on the web: XML, JSON, CSV, RDF, etc. Refer to [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#dataFormats">Data Formats</a> for more information and best practices. </p>
        <p>That being said, it is important to publish your spatial data with clear semantics, i.e. to provide information about the contents of your data. The primary use case
          for this is you have information about a collection of SpatialThings and you want to
          publish precise information about their attributes and how they are inter-related. Another
          use case is the publication on the Web of a dataset that has a spatial component in a form
          that search engines will understand. </p>
        <p>Depending on the format you use, the semantics may already be described in some form. For example, in GeoJSON this description is present in the [[GeoJSON]] specification. When using JSON it is possible to add semantics using a JSON-LD @context. For providing semantics to search engines, using schema.org is a good option, as explained in <a href="#indexable-by-search-engines" class="sectionRef">BP 3: Make your data indexable by search engines</a>. </p>
        <p>In a linked data setting, the attributes of a spatial thing can be described using existing vocabularies, where
          each term has a published definition. [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#ReuseVocabularies">BP15: Reuse vocabularies, preferably standardized ones</a> recommends using terms from an established widely used vocabulary. If you can't find a suitable existing vocabulary term, you should create
          your own, and publish a clear definition for the new term (see [[LD-BP]]. We recommend that you link your own vocabulary to commonly used existing ones
          because this increases its usefulness. We provide the mapping between some commonly used spatial vocabularies. </p>
        <div class="issue" data-number="225">
          <p>We must avoid being overly focused on RDF.</p>
          <p>The [[LD-BP]] reference makes this section very RDF dependent. Is there a need /
            justification for this? Are we saying that RDF is the only recommended way to publish
            data and models on the Web? Web developers may not care about RDF vocabularies and maybe
            they prefer a Swagger document (just to pick an example)?</p>
          <p>To reduce the RDF focus, some text was added. </p>

          <p>The current list of RDF vocabularies / OWL ontologies for spatial data being considered

          <p>The NOTE will be concerned with helping data publishers choose the right
            spatial data format or vocabulary. It provides a methodology for
            making that choice. We do this rather than recommending one vocabulary because this

        <p class="note">The motivation behind the <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/locn#">ISA Programme
            Location Core Vocabulary</a> was establishing a <em>minimal core common</em> to existing
          spatial vocabularies. However, experience suggests that such a <em>minimal common
            core</em> is not very useful as one quickly need to employ specific semantics to meet
          one's application needs.</p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="37">Do we need a subclass of <a>SpatialThing</a> for
            entities that do not have a clearly defined spatial extent; or a property that expresses

          <h4>Describing location</h4>
          <p>Location information is often a common thread running through such data and can be an important 'hook' for finding information and for integrating different datasets. There are different ways of describing the location of spatial things. You can use and/or refer to the name of a wellknown named place (refer to BP18-19), provide the location's coordinates as a geometry or describe it in relation to another location. These last two options are described in this section.</p>

              <li>Support the dimensionality of the geometry;</li>

          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>Steps to follow: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Decide on the geometric data representations based on performance; often the
                geometry data is a large proportion of the total size of a dataset.</li>
              <li>Determine the dimensionality of geometry data (0d 'point' to 3d 'volume').</li>
              <li>Determine in which coordinate reference system(s) (CRS) the data should be published (ref to section about CRS). Not all formats and vocabularies support the use of other CRS besides the most common one on the Web, WGS84.</li>
              <li>Determine which format(s) are supported by software tools that you anticipate
                your user community to employ; where multiple formats are in required, consider
                offering as many representations as you can - balancing the benefit of ease of use
                against the cost of the additional storage or additional processing if converting
                on-the-fly. See [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/bp.html#Conneg">Best
                  Practice 22: Serving data and resources with different formats</a> for more
                information.</li>
              <li>Choose the right format and decide when to use geometry literals. For geometry
                literals, several solutions are available, like Well-Known Text (<a>WKT</a>)
                representations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash">GeoHash</a> and
                other geocoding representations. The alternative is to use structured geometry
                objects as is possible, for example, in [[GeoSPARQL]].</li>
              <li>There are also several suitable binary data formats (e.g. <a
                  href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">Google's protocol
                  buffers</a> for vector tiling); however, some binary formats do not
                (effectively) work on the Web as there are no software tools for working with
                those formats from within a typical Web application; to work with data in such
                formats, you must first download the data and then work with it locally. </li>
              <li>There are widespread practices for representing geometric data as linked data,
                such as using W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#">WGS84 Geo
                  Positioning vocabulary</a> (geo) <code>geo:lat</code> and <code>geo:long</code>
                that are used extensively for describing <code>geo:Point</code> objects.</li>
              <li>Concrete geometry types are available, such as those defined in the OpenGIS
                [[Simple-Features]] Specification, namely 0-dimensional Point and MultiPoint;
                1-dimensional curve LineString and MultiLineString; 2-dimensional surface Polygon
                and MultiPolygon; and the heterogeneous GeometryCollection. </li>

          <h4>Publishing data with clear semantics</h4>
          <p>In most cases, the effective use of information resources requires understanding
            thematic concepts in addition to the spatial ones; "spatial" is just a facet of the
            broader information space. For example, when the <a
              href="http://www.brandweer.nl/amsterdam-amstelland">Dutch Fire Service</a> responded
            to an incident at a day care center, they needed to evacuate the children. In this case,
            the <em>2nd</em> closest alternative day care center was preferred because it was
            operated by the same organization as the one that was subject of the incident, and they
            knew who all the children were.</p>
          <p>This best practice document provides mechanisms for determining how places and
            locations are related - but determining the compatibility or validity of thematic data
            elements is beyond our scope; we're not attempting to solve the problem of different
            views on the same/similar resources.</p>

              <p>Entities and their properties are described using common and reusable vocabularies

            <section class="how">
              <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
              <p>There are various vocabularies that provide common information (semantics) about
                spatial things, such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/"> Basic Geo
                  vocabulary</a>, [[GeoSPARQL]] or <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>. </p>
              <p class="note">Work is underway on an <a href="http://geosemweb.org/sdwgeo">update for the GeoSPARQL spatial ontology</a>. This will provide an agreed spatial ontology conformant to the ISO 19107 abstract model and will be based on existing available ontologies such as GeoSPARQL, the W3C basic geo vocabulary, NeoGeo and the ISA Core Location vocabulary. This best practice will recommend the use of this spatial ontology. </p>
                <p>This best practice provides a method for selecting the right vocabulary (or vocabularies)
                for your intended goal. The semantic description of entities and their properties
                should use the existing common vocabularies in their descriptions to increase the
                interoperability with other descriptions that may refer to the same vocabularies.
                The steps required to choose the best vocabularies are: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Go through a selection process to decide on the existing and relevant
                  vocabularies that can be used to describe the spatial things and their properties. </li>
                <li>Maintain links to the vocabularies in the schema definitions and provide
                  linked-data descriptions.</li>
                <li>Define location and spatial references using the common vocabulary concepts
                  whenever applicable instead of defining your own location instance. </li>
                <li>Provide thematic semantics and general descriptions of spatial things and their
                  properties as linked data. They should have URIs that return human and machine
                  readable definitions when resolved. For more information refer to [[DWBP]] <a

        <h3>Spatial Data Access</h3>
        <p><a>SDIs</a> have long been used to provide access to spatial data via web services;
          typically using open standard specifications from the <a
            href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> (OGC). With the
          exception of the <a>Web Map Service</a>, these OGC Web service specifications have not
          seen widespread adoption beyond the geospatial expert community. In parallel, we have seen
          widespread emergence of Web applications that use spatial data.</p>
        <p>[[DWBP]] provides best practices discussing access to data using Web infrastructure (see [[DWBP]] <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/bp.html#dataAccess">section 8.10 Data Access</a>). This
          section provides additional insight for publishers of spatial data. </p>

        <p>Making data available on the Web requires data publishers to provide some form of
          access to the data. There are numerous mechanisms available, each providing varying
          levels of utility and incurring differing levels of effort and cost to implement and
          maintain. Publishers of spatial data should make their data available on the Web using
          affordable mechanisms in order to ensure long-term, sustainable access to their
          data.</p>
        <p>When determining the mechanism to be used provide Web access to data, publishers need
          to assess utility against cost. In order of increasing usefulness and cost:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Bulk-download or streaming of the entire dataset (see [[DWBP]] <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#BulkAccess">Best Practice 17: Provide bulk
              download</a>) - note that providing bulk download is useful in any case</li>
          <li>Generalized query API (for spatial data: <a>WFS</a> or [[GeoSPARQL]] )</li>
          <li>Bespoke API designed to support a particular application (see [[DWBP]] <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#useanAPI">Best Practice 23: Make data available through an API</a>)</li>

          <p><span id="convenience-apis" class="practicelab">Expose spatial data through
              'convenience APIs'</span></p>
          <p class="practicedesc">If you have a specific application in mind for publishing your
            data, tailor the spatial data API to meet that goal.</p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>When access to spatial data is provided by bulk download or through a generalized
              query service, users need to understand how the data is structured in order to work
              effectively with that data. Given that spatial data may be arbitrarily complex, this
              burdens the data user with significant effort before they can even perform simple
              queries. In addition, spatial datasets tend to be large. <strong>Convenience APIs</strong> are tailored to meet a specific goal;
              enabling a user to engage with arbitrarily complex data structures using (a set of)
              simple queries. </p>
          </section>
          <section class="outcome">
            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>The API provides a coherent set of queries and operations, including spatial ones, that help users get working with the data quickly to achieve
              common tasks. The API provides both machine readable data and human readable HTML markup; the
                latter is used by search engines to index the spatial data.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>The API should offer <em>both</em> machine readable data and human readable HTML that
              includes the structured metadata required by search engines seeking to index content
              (see <a href="#indexable-by-search-engines" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 3: Make your entity-level
                data indexable by search engines</a> for more details).</p>
            <p>When designing APIs, data publishers must be aware of the constraints of operating in
              a Web environment. Providing access to large spatial datasets, such as <a>coverages</a>, is a
              particular challenge. The API should provide mechanisms to request subsets of the
              dataset that are a convenient size for client applications to manage.</p>
            <p>In the geospatial domain there are a lot of <a>WFS</a> services providing data. A
              RESTful API as a wrapper, proxy or a shim layer could be created around WFS services. GML
              content from the WFS service could be provided in this way as linked data or another
              Web friendly format. This approach is similar to the use of Z39.50 in the library
              community; that protocol is still used but 'modern' Web sites and web services are
              wrapped around it. Adding URIs in (GML) data exposed by a WFS is pretty
              straightforward, but making the data 'webby' is harder. There are examples of this
              approach of creating a convenience API that works dynamically on top of WFS such as the experimental <a href="https://github.com/interactive-instruments/ldproxy">LD Proxy</a>. This requires relatively little effort and is an attractive option for quickly exposing spatial data from existing WFS services on the Web.</p>
            <p>A more effective route may be to provide an alternative 'Linked Data
              friendly' access path to the data source; creating a new, complementary service
              endpoint e.g. expose the underpinning postGIS database via SPARQL endpoint (using
              something like <a href="http://www.melodiesproject.eu/content/ontop-spatial"
                >ontop-spatial</a>) and Linked Data API.</p>

            <p>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#ProvideSubsets">Best Practice 18: Provide Subsets for Large Datasets</a> explains why providing subsets is important. Spatial datasets, particularly <a>coverages</a> such as satellite imagery, sensor
              measurement timeseries and climate prediction data, are often very large. In these cases it is useful to provide subsets by having identifiers for conveniently
              sized subsets of large datasets that Web applications can work with.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>Two possible approaches are described below:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Create named subsets. <ul>
                  <li>Determine how users may seek to access the dataset, determining subsets of the
                    larger dataset that are appropriate for the intended application. A data
                    provider may consider a general approach to improve accessibility of a dataset,
                    while a data user might want to publish details of a workflow for others to
                    reuse referencing only the relevant parts of the large dataset.</li>
                  <li>Given the anticipated access pattern, create new resources and mint a new
                    identifier for each subset.</li>
                  <li>Provide metadata to indicate how a given subset resource is related to the
                    original large dataset, with reference to an identified <em>Mutually Exclusive
                      Collectively Exhaustive</em> (MECE) set where appropriate.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Map a URI pattern to an existing data-access API. <p class="note">A Web service
                  URL in general does not provide a good URI for a resource as it is unlikely to be
                  persistent. A Web service URL is often technology and implementation dependent and
                  both are very likely to change with time. For example, consider oft used
                  parameters such as <code>?version=</code>. Good practice is to use URIs that will
                  resolve as long as the resource is relevant and may be referenced by others,
                  therefore identifiers for subsets should be <em>protocol independent</em>.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Identify the service end-point that provides access to the larger
                    dataset.</li>
                  <li>Determine which parameters offered by the service end-point are required to
                    construct a meaningful subset.</li>
                  <li>Map these parameters into a URI pattern and configure an HTTP server to apply
                    the necessary URL-rewrite.</li>

        <h3>Linking Spatial Data</h3>
        <p>Earlier in this document, the <a href="#linked-data" class="sectionRef">Linked Data</a> section explained that we  believe that Linked Data requires only that the formats used to publish data support Web linking. In other words, linking spatial data does not automatically mean the use of RDF; links can also be created, for example, using GML, HTML or JSON-LD.</p>
        <p>Links, in whatever machine-readable form, are important. In the wider Web, it is links that enable the discovery of web pages: from user-agents
          following a hyperlink to find related information to search engines using links to
          prioritize and refine search results. This section is concerned with the creation and use
          of those links to support discovery of the <a>SpatialThings</a> described in spatial
          datasets.</p>
        <p>For data to be <em>on the web</em> the resources it describes need to be connected, or
            <em>linked</em>, to other resources. The <em>connectedness</em> of data is one of the
          fundamentals of the Linked Data approach that these best practices build upon. The <a
            href="http://5stardata.info">5-star rating for Linked Open Data</a> asserts that to
          achieve the fifth star you must "link your data to other data to provide context". The
          benefits for consumers and publishers of linking to other data are <a
            href="http://5stardata.info/en/#addendum5">listed</a> as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can discover more (related) data while consuming the data.</li>
          <li>You can directly learn about the data schema.</li>
          <li>You make your data discoverable.</li>
          <li>You increase the value of your data.</li>
          <li>Your own organization will gain the same benefits from the links as the [other]
            consumers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Just like any type of data, spatial data benefits massively from linking when publishing
          on the web. The widespread use of links within data is regarded as one of the most
          significant departures from contemporary practices used within SDIs. That's why this topic is included in this Best Practice.</p>
       <p>Crucially, the use of links is predicated on the ability to identify the origin and
          target, or <em>beginning</em> and <em>end</em>, of the link. <a
            href="#globally-unique-ids">Best Practice 6: Use globally unique HTTP identifiers for
            spatial things</a> is a prerequisite.</p>
        <p>This section extends [[DWBP]] by providing a best practice about
            <em>creating</em> links between the resources described inside datasets. <!-- revise -->Best practices
          detailing the use of links to support discovery are provided in <a href="#bp-discovery"
            class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>
        <div class="note">
          <p>[[DWBP]] identifies <em>Linkability</em> as one of the <a
              href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#bp-benefits">benefits</a> gained from implementing
            the Data on the Web best practices (see [[DWBP]] <a

          <p><span id="entity-level-links" class="practicelab">Publish links to related resources</span></p>
          <p class="practicedesc">The data should be published with explicit links, including spatial links, to spatial things or other
            resources,  both in the same dataset and in other datasets. </p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>Exposing entity-level links to web applications, user-agents and web crawlers allows
              the relationships between resources to be found without the data user needing to
              download the entire dataset for local analysis. Entity-level links, preferably meaningful links, provide explicit
              description of the relationships between resources and enable users to find related
              data and determine whether the related data is worth accessing. Entity-level links can
              be used to combine information from different sources; for example, to determine
              correlations in statistical data relating to the same location. </p>
            <p>Data publishers should assert the relationships that they know about. Relationships between resources with with spatial extent (i.e. size, shape, or position; SpatialThings) can often be inferred from their spatial properties,but this is a complex task. It requires both complex spatial processing (e.g. region connection calculus)  and some degree of understanding about the semantics of the two, potentially related, resources in order to determine how they are related, if at all. This should not be left to the data user.</p>
            <p>When your spatial resources are linked to those in common usage it will be easier to discover them. For example, a data user interested in air quality data about the place they live might begin by searching for that place in popular data repositories such as GeoNames, Wikidata or DBpedia. Once the user finds the resource that describes the correct place, they can search for data that refers to the identified resource that, in this case, relates to air quality. Furthermore, by referring to resources in common usage, it becomes even easier to find those resources as search engines will prioritize resources that are linked to more often.</p>

            <p>2. Make spatial relationships explicit</p>

            <p>It is a good idea to express spatial relationships between things explicitly in your data. A possible approach for this is to find out if they have corresponding geometries using spatial functions, and then express these correspondences as explicit relationships. If the spatial datasets you want to reconcile are managed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) or a spatial database, you can use the GIS spatial functions to find related spatial things. If your spatial things are expressed as Linked Data, you can use [GeoSPARQL], which has a set of spatial query functions available.</p>

              <p>The mechanics of how to decide when two resources are related, if they don't have geometric or topological properties that allow you to determine this, are beyond the scope of this best practice. Tools (e.g. <a href="http://openrefine.org">OpenRefine</a>
                and <a href="http://silk-framework.com">Silk Linked Data Integration Framework</a>)
                are available to assist with reconciliation based on e.g. geographical names or addresses present in the data and may provide further insight.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="note">
              <p>Where possible, existing identifiers should be reused when referring to resources (see <a href="http://w3c.github.io/sdw/bp/#reuse-ids">Best Practice 2: Reuse existing (authoritative) identifiers when available</a>). However, the use of multiple identifiers for the same resource is commonplace, for example, where data publishers from different jurisdictions refer to the same <a>SpatialThing</a>. In this special case, properties such as <code>owl:sameAs</code> can be used to declare that multiple identifiers refer to the same resource. It is often the case that data published from different sources about the same physical or conceptual resource may provide different view points. Note that you shouldn't use <code>owl:sameAs</code> to indicate that two spatial things are only similar, while not exactly the same.</p>

            <p>3. Decide which spatial relationships to use</p>
            <p>To let user agents know what is at the end of a link, it's a good idea to use explicitly defined relationship types to link between resources. [[DWBP]] <a

            <p>Describing the spatial relationships between SpatialThings can be based on
              relationships such as topological (e.g. contains), geographical (e.g. nearby) and hierarchical (e.g. part of) links.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A good place to find spatial relationships to use is in spatial vocabularies. See <a href="#semantic-thing" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 9: Use spatial semantics for Spatial Things</a>.</li>
              <li>The geographical, topological and social hierarchy should be described with clear semantics and registered with IANA <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml">Link relations</a>.</li>
              <li>Hierarchical relationships (i.e. part of, for example between administrative regions, have a specific need for defining <em>Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive</em> (MECE) set.</li>
              <li>Topological relationships that are described for an entity should have references to concepts such as over, under etc.</li>
              <li>Spatial relationships can use concepts such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_connection_calculus">Region Connection Calculus</a> (RCC8) that contains, overlaps, touches, intersects, adjacent to, or "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM#Spatial_predicates">spatial predicates</a>" or also other similar concepts from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%27s_interval_algebra">Allen Calculus</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Social relationships can be defined based on perception; e.g. "samePlaceAs", nearby, south of. These relationships can also be defined based on temporal concepts such as: after, around, etc. In current practice, there is no such property as <code>samePlaceAs</code> to express the social notion of <em>place</em>; enabling communities to unambiguously indicate that they are referring to the same place but without getting hung up on the semantic complexities inherent in the use of <code>owl:sameAs</code> or similar.</p>

            <p>4. Determine the things to link to</p>
            <p>The links should connect spatial things rather than information resource(s) that describe them. In many cases, different identifiers are used to describe the <a>SpatialThing</a> and the information resource that describes that <a>SpatialThing</a>. For example, within <a href="http://dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>, the city of Sapporo, Japan, is identified as <code>http://dbpedia.org/<u>resource</u>/Sapporo</code>, while the information resource that describes this resource is identified as <code>http://dbpedia.org/<u>page</u>/Sapporo</code>. Care should be taken to select the identifier for the <a>SpatialThing</a> rather than the information resource that describes it; in the example above, this is <code>http://dbpedia.org/<u>resource</u>/Sapporo</code>.</p>
            <p>Besides making the links to things within the same dataset explicit, data publishers should also relate their data to commonly used spatial resources such as GeoNames using links. </p>
            <p>A list of sources of commonly used spatial resources is provided in
              <a href="#auth-id-sources" class="sectionRef"></a>. </p>

              <p>This best practice is concerned with the connections <em>between</em>
                <a>SpatialThings</a>. When describing an individual <a>SpatialThing</a> itself, it is often desirable to decompose the information into several uniquely identified objects. For example, the geometry of an administrative area may be managed as a separate resource due to the large number of geometric points required to describe the boundary.</p>

            <li>Expressing properties and features of interest for a <a>SpatialThing</a> using
              common semantic descriptions.</li>

              names (that local people use for a place). This part will explain in more detail how
              to provide the names/labels for the spatial things that are referred to. (e.g. a way
              to do this could be rdfs:label)</li>
            <li>A 'place' may have an indistinct (or even undefined) boundary. It is often useful to

      <h2>Narrative - the Nieuwhaven flooding</h2>
      <p>This narrative introduces a flooding scenario as a background story for the Best
        Practice.</p>
      <p class="note">Names and places used in this scenario are fictional, procedures and practices
        may not reflect those used in the real world. Our intent is to provide a coherent context
        within which the best practices can be illustrated. We <strong>do not</strong> attempt to
        provide best practice for management of flooding events. However, many of the procedures
        discussed are based on information from <a

      <p>Nieuwhaven is a flourishing coastal city in the Netherlands. In common with much of the
        Netherlands, the low lying nature of Nieuwhaven make it prone to flooding from both rivers
        and the North Sea. To mitigate or reduce risks to homes and businesses, significant
        investment has been made to flood control and water management infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Flood Risk Management and Water Management are integrated in the Netherlands. By combining
        responsibilities for daily water management and flood risk management, the same people are
        involved who have a detailed knowledge of their water systems and flood defences.</p>

      <p>Flood risk management can be separated into three layers: </p>
      <ol >
        <li>Flood alerts, evacuation, response and recovery (civil protection issues); both
          organisational and physical measures (e.g. identifying, checking, repairing and signalling
          evacuation routes).</li>
        <li>Spatial planning issues; reducing the impact of flooding through planning
          measures.</li>
        <li>Flood protection; constructing flood defences to reduce the probability [of
          inundation and the impact of flooding]</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Our scenario concentrates on element (3).</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Describing predicted flood extent using vector geometries</h2>
        <p>The Nieuwhaven Water Board is the independent local government body responsible for regional water management; maintaining the system of dikes, drainage, canals and pumping stations that are designed to keep the city and surrounding environment from flooding. </p>
        <p>Based on assessment of historical flooding events, Newhaven Water Board is able to determine the extent of flooding that would occur as the result of hypothetical storm surge and river flooding events. </p>
        <div class="example">

          <ul>
            <li> inundation extent from hypothetical scenarios</li>

        <h2>Publishing statistical data for geographic areas</h2>
        <p>Municipal emergency services, public health authorities and water boards are grouped according to a “safety region” in order to establish a multi-disciplinary “emergency team” for crisis management. This helps to ensure that there is effective communication between those responsible for public safety and those responsible for flood control and water management.</p>
        <p>Each safety region prepares systematically for its own specific characteristics, based on available capabilities. This plan, the “Flood Response Plan”, includes evacuation strategies that are developed in response to hypothetical flooding events. Scenarios are prepared beforehand and carefully considered. The emergency team must be prepared at all times to deliver an assessment on a disaster / incident scenario and advise on proposed interventions, e.g. evacuation and deployment of temporary flood defences.</p>
        <p>In developing the Flood Response Plan, the numbers of citizens impacted by each hypothetical flooding event are determined by cross-referencing the areas affected by surface water flooding with census data.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/about-us/organisation">Statistics Netherlands</a> (CBS) publishes reliable and coherent statistical information which respond to the needs of Dutch society and is responsible for compiling official national statistics.</p>
        <p>CBS makes use of OData, the Open Data Protocol v4, to provide open datasets for use by third parties. Furthermore, CBS provides a search interface to help a user find the dataset of interest. Data is also provided in CSV format.</p>
        <p>CBS provides metadata for the census dataset, in both human- and machine-readable forms. A download of each dataset is available, but may leave the data user with more data than they can conveniently work with. Users are often interested only in the subset of areas that are relevant to them - such as those by flooding. CBS provides an API enabling the user to retrieve the relevant data by selecting the area of interest and, optionally, choosing specific dimensions of the statistical data.</p>
        <p>Census data naturally takes the form of a statistical 'data cube', with statistical dimensions of area, time, gender, age range etc. A useful standards-based approach to making the data available would be to represent it as RDF, using the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary [[vocab-data-cube]]. This offers a standards based way to represent statistical data and associated metadata as RDF. API access to the data could be provided via a SPARQL endpoint, or a more specific API. The Linked Data API, implemented by Epimorphics’ ELDA, provides a useful mechanism to expose simple RESTful APIs on top of RDF/SPARQL.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Publishing data about administrative areas</h2>
        <p>Population data from a census is typically broken down by area, gender, age (and perhaps other statistical dimensions) and relates to a particular time.</p>
        <p>CBS uses established URLs to identify each each administrative area for which population data is available. Details of the administrative areas for Nieuwhaven are published by the municipal government. This information includes the geometry for each administrative area.</p>
        <p>Data about administrative areas are often useful - perhaps they represent one of the most popular spatial datasets. In this case they are useful for coordinating the emergency response, i.e. predicting and tracking which neighbourhoods or districts are threatened. Because the names of local administrative areas such as neighbourhoods are very well known they are also useful for communication with citizens, i.e. letting them know if their neighbourhood is threatened by the flood or not.</p>
        <p>Because the administrative area datasets is quite popular, all kinds of data users will want to use it - not only GIS experts. To enable them to find the data on the web, it was published in such a way that search engines can crawl the data, making the data findable using popular search engines.</p>
        <div class="example">
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>tbd add example including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>publish administrative areas with geometry</li>
            <li>geometries published with national CRS via SDI (this could be converted in the browser using proj4.js)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Correlating statistical and geographic areas to assess impact</h2>
        <p>By cross-referencing the population statistics, administrative areas and surface water flooding extent (e.g. by calculating the intersection of the flood with administrative areas), the number of citizens impacted by each hypothetical flooding event can be estimated.</p>
        <p>Once the number of citizens that need refuge has been determined, the emergency teams can designate public buildings, such as schools and sports centres, as evacuation points and define safe transit routes to get to those points.</p>
      </section>         
      <section>
        <h2>Publishing data about topographic features with associated discovery metadata</h2>
        <p>The municipal government published details of the built infrastructure within Nieuwhaven, including public buildings and transport infrastructure.</p>
        <div class="example">
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>tbd add example including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> each feature is uniquely identified</li>
            <li>each feature is indexed by search engines</li>
            <li>dataset is published as vector tile-set (like OSM)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The municipal government also publishes metadata describing each dataset (DWBP-BP1) that, besides free text descriptions (e.g., title, abstract), include the following information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the type of objects/features described - e.g., with a thematic classification (DWBP-BP2)</li>
          <li>spatial coverage / temporal coverage - to identify if data match the area of interest </li>
          <li>coordinate reference system(s) used - to correctly interpret geometries</li>
          <li>spatial resolution - to identify data with the right level of detail </li>
          <li>distribution format(s) and API to get access to the data (at a different level of granularity) - to identify those datasets consumable by the intended application(s) (DWBP-BP4, DWBP-BP13)</li>
          <li>date of last modification - to see whether data are up to date (DWBP-BP8) </li>
          <li>the parties responsible for the creation and maintenance of the data - to verify data authoritativeness (DWBP-BP6)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To facilitate data discoverability, metadata should be published via different channels and formats (DWBP-BP22). Nowadays, such metadata are typically maintained in geospatial catalogues, encoded based on [[ISO19115]] - the standard for spatial metadata. In addition to this, such metadata can be served in RDF, and made queryable via a SPARQL endpoint; e.g. [[GeoDCAT-AP]] provides an XSLT-based <a href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/stash/projects/ODCKAN/repos/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/browse">mechanism</a> to automatically transform ISO 19115 metadata into RDF, following a schema based on the W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary [[vocab-dcat]].</p>
        <p>This solution can be further enhanced by making data discoverable and indexable via search engines. The advantage is that this would allow data consumers to discover the data even though they do not know the relevant catalogue(s), and to find alternative data sources.</p>
        <p>This can be achieved, following Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) techniques, by embedding metadata in catalogue’s Web pages, with mechanisms like HTML-RDFa, Microdata, and Microformats. Examples of this approach include the following ones:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In the <a href="https://geo4web-testbed.github.io/topic4/">Geonovum testbed</a>, dataset pages from a spatial catalogue embed metadata, represented by using the [[SCHEMA-ORG]] vocabulary, directly generated from the relevant ISO 19115 records.</li>
          <li>The <a href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/stash/projects/ODCKAN/repos/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/browse/api" >experimental GeoDCAT-AP API</a> allows data publishers to serve ISO 19115 records in different RDF serialisation formats, including HTML+RDFa, on top of a spatial catalogue and/or an OGC Catalog Service for the Web [[CSW]].</li>

        <h2>Using spatial relations</h2>
        <p>Temporary flood defences are common where roads and railways cross permanent flood defences or are built up on boulevards along rivers. Also, temporary flood defences are also deployed where dikes have not passed their annual visual inspection or 5-yearly assessment. Information regarding the condition of dikes cannot be incorporated into the plan, and must be considered during an actual flood event.</p>
        <div class="example">
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>tbd add examples including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>individual transport network segments and flood defence features are uniquely identified</li>
            <li>spatial relations are used to define where transport infrastructure cross flood defences, and hence quickly determine where to deploy temporary flood defences without the need for detailed spatial analysis … this can be used to demonstrate 3rd-party linking; e.g. the spatial relations are published by an organisation that owns nether of the target datasets</li>
            <li>locations for temporary flood defences are provided to the relevant emergency services teams</li>

        <h2>Publishing coverage data about predicted water depth</h2>
        <p>Storm surge and river flood warning services are provided by the National Water Management Centre (WMCN) at <a href="https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/">Rijkswaterstaat</a>, who are responsible for the design, construction, management and maintenance of the main infrastructure facilities in the Netherlands such as the main road network, the main waterway network and water systems.</p>
        <p>The storm surge warning service is triggered by storm surge alert from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), the Dutch national weather service. A forecast combination of heavy rainfall, high-tide and storm makes it likely that a flooding will occur in the next 120 hours. Specialists use meteorological, hydrological and urban flood prediction models within the Flood Early Warning System (FEWS) to estimate peak water-levels, when these will occur and which area will likely be flooded.</p>
        <p>The Storm surge warnings consist of predicted maximum water levels and a general description of wind and tide. 10-minute water level forecasts are computed and distributed, including details of wave run-up and overtopping for dikes.</p>
        <p>Every 6 hours, new meteorological predications are incorporated into the flood prediction, resulting in a new version of the 10-minute water level forecast dataset being made available.</p>
        <div class="example">
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>tbd add example including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>landing page (with descriptive metadata) for each forecast dataset</li>

      <section>
        <h2>Using an API to make it easy to work with spatial data</h2>
        <p>The emergency team for the Nieuwhaven safety region compare the predictions for the forecast flooding event against the hypothetical scenarios developed in the Flood Response Plan to determine which of the prepared response plans to execute.</p>
        <p>Based on this assessment, the imminent flooding event requires a number of temporary flood defences to be deployed and evacuation of some districts of Nieuwhaven.</p>
        <p>The emergency team identify where additional temporary flood defences are required due to any dikes that are in a state of disrepair (e.g. having failed their annual or 5-yearly assessments).</p>
        <div class="example">
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>tbd add example: </p>
          <p> cross reference the location of each damaged dike with predicted high-water level, determined via an API call into the 10-minute water level forecasts to extract a water level time-series for a given point to determine if the water level is predicted to exceed a threshold, in which case, temporary flood defences will be required.</p>

      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Making spatial data comsumable by both humans and machines</h2>
        <p>Details of the emergency and the evacuation plan must be communicated to citizens. They are kept informed during and prior to the event using multiple channels:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>local radio and television networks</li>
          <li>news and media agencies; television, radio and <strong>on-line</strong></li>
          <li>official national Government website www.crisis.nl, including specific information about flooding events</li>
          <li>cell broadcasting via the Government’s NL-Alert system, providing SMS message alerts to all mobile phones in the vicinity of a life and health threatening emergency</li>
          <li>air raid sirens</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The evacuation plan must be discoverable by the public. The intent is for each plan to be both human (primarily) and machine readable. The requirement for machine readability is mostly to support automated discovery of the content via web search. The URL itself ideally should also be "human friendly" as it should be easy to share verbally in addition to being embedded and linked to from other web pages.</p>
        <p>While making the plans clear and understandable to human readers is well understood (and beyond the scope of this best practices document!). The challenge is to make the content machine readable. The use of a simple tag based schema using microdata, RDFa or JSON-LD is recommended. A simple first step might be to use the schema.org "<code><a href="http://schema.org/Event">schema:Event</a></code>" item tag <code>&lt;div class="event-wrapper" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Event"&gt;</code>, which has useful generic properties of date, location, duration etc. The places of evacuation refuges (e.g. schools, sports centres etc) should be tagged using the generic "<code><a href="http://schema.org/Place">schema:Place</a></code>".</p>

        </div>
        <p>Details of the evacuation route should be provided ideally as a textual description (perhaps machine readable using the schema.org "TravelAction" item, although this is rather limited) and a graphical representation. Potentially route information could be encoded using a format such as <a href="http://www.openlr.org/index.html">OpenLR</a> but this has not achieved widespread adoption.</p>

        <h2>Providing simple access to spatial data through 'convenience' APIs</h2>
        <p>News and media agencies provide Web applications that help communicate the evacuation to citizens as effectively as possible; e.g. by creating simple Web applications that direct one to the correct evacuation plan based on their postal code or online mapping tools. Media agencies may cross-reference evacuation plans with Features that have non-official identifiers; e.g. from <a href="http://what3words.com">What3Words</a> (W3W) or <a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a>.</p>

        <h2>Publishing geographic information in simple tabular data</h2>
        <p>During a flood event, the Flood Response Plan indicates that emergency services will have to focus their efforts on reducing the number of fatalities. This means that if an evacuation order is given, the efforts of the emergency services will be focused on traffic control and on non self reliant groups.</p>
        <p>As the flood event progresses, the emergency services provide evacuation assistance for the vulnerable, such as the residents of care homes. </p>
        <p>The municipal public health authority publishes details of care homes and other health care facilities on-line as open data, using a simple CSV format.</p>

        <h2>Publishing real-time data streams from sensors</h2>
        <p>During floods and storm surges, professionals (often aided by trained volunteers) constantly monitor all flood defences. Measurements include: water level, wave height, wind speed and direction.</p>
        <p>The emergency team use these observations to monitor the rising water levels to ensure that these are consistent with the predictions (both in terms of timing and peak water-level) in case additional interventions, such as evacuating more districts, are required.</p>
        <p>A real-time data stream of water level at a specific location within Nieuwhaven’s canals is published from an automated monitoring system operated by the Water Board; e.g. a Web-enabled sensor.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, the prediction is sufficiently accurate that the evacuation plan remains effective.

        <h2>Using social media to convey spatial data</h2>
        <p>During the flood, citizens themselves become engaged with the flood event; they use social media to post geo-tagged messages regarding their observations of the flood (“the #flood has reached my home” or “Mount Pleasant Road closed at junction with Acacia Avenue #flood”, perhaps accompanied by photographs) or offer localized help (“come charge your phone at my porch #floodresponse”).</p>
        <p>The aggregated social media messages are used by the emergency team to complement the monitoring data provided by the Water Board, tracking the progress of the flooding event in near real-time.</p>
        <div class="example">
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>tbd add example including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>social media, water extent … VGI … <a href="https://twitter.com/leoniemellor/status/738884030511222785">https://twitter.com/leoniemellor/status/738884030511222785</a> … aggregated social media posts; situational awareness … how to reconcile place names with resources formally identified with URLs? … especially where local or informal place names (with ‘fuzzy’ boundaries) are used (e.g. “north of Downtown”)</li>
            <li>… ambiguity: “#flooding the water is 2 feet deep at my house”</li>
            <li>… social media platform providers drive collection of particular information from users of the platform</li>
            <li>… or volunteers might blog, creating content in HTML using a publishing App</li>
            <li>geotagging photos of flood extent ... using EXIF data from photos ... provide an API to search that resource [Instagram] ... emergency responders use this to track the progress of the flood against prediction</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Due to the prioritisation of emergency services elsewhere, the Flood Response Plan assumes that the general public will have to be self reliant or resilient for a number of days.</p>
        <p>Using social media, local businesses offer services to those affected by the flood; for example, a local bakery offers food and water and asks for help to move these supplies to the evacuation refuge nearby.</p>

      <h2>Applicability of common formats to implementation of Best Practices</h2>
      <p>The Spatial Data on the Web working group is working on recommendations about the use of
        formats for publishing spatial data on the web, specifically about selecting the most
        appropriate format. There may not be one most appropriate format: which format is best may
        depend on many things. This section gives two tables that both aim to be helpful in
        selecting the right format in a given situation. These tables may in future be merged or
        reworked in other ways. </p>
      <p>The first table is a matrix of the common formats, showing in general terms how well these
        formats help achieve goals such as discoverability, granularity etc. </p>

      <h2>Authoritative sources of geographic identifiers</h2>
      <p>As per <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html"
          >http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html</a> item 4, it's useful for people to link
        their data to other related data. In this context we're most frequently talking about either
        Spatial Things and/or their geometry.</p>
      <p> There are many useful sets of identifiers for spatial things and which ones are most
        useful will depend on context. This involves discovering relevant URIs that you might want
        to connect to.</p>
      <p>Relevant URIs for spatial things can be found in many places. This list gives the first
        places you should check:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://dbpedia.org">DBpedia</a></li>
        <li>National open spatial datasets such as are made available by for example the UK and
          Dutch governments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finding out which national open spatial datasets are available, and how they can be
        accessed, currently requires prior knowledge in most cases because these datasets are often
        not easily discoverable. Look for national dataportals / geoportals such as <a
          href="http://nationaalgeoregister.nl">Nationaal Georegister</a> (Dutch national register
        of spatial datasets) or <a href="https://data.overheid.nl">Dataportaal van de Nederlandse
          overheid</a> (Dutch national governmental data portal). </p>
      <div class="example">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>As an example, let's take Edinburgh. In some recent work with the Scottish Government, we
          have an identifier for the City of Edinburgh Council Area - i.e. the geographical area
          that Edinburgh City Council is responsible for:</p>
        <code>http://statistics.gov.scot/id/statistical-geography/S12000036</code>
        <p>(note that this URI doesn't resolve yet but it will in the next couple of months once the
          system goes properly live)</p>
        <p>The UK government provides an identifier for Edinburgh and/or information about it that
          we might want to link to:</p>
        <p><a href="http://statistics.data.gov.uk/id/statistical-geography/S12000036"
            >http://statistics.data.gov.uk/id/statistical-geography/S12000036</a></p>
        <p>The Scottish identifier is directly based on this one, but the Scottish Government wanted
          the ability to create something dereferenceable, potentially with additional or different
          info to the data.gov.uk one. These two are owl:sameAs.</p>
        <p><a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh"></a></p>
        <p>DBpedia also includes a resource about Edinburgh. Relationship: "more or less the same
          as" but probably not the strict semantics of owl:sameAs.</p>

        <p>This Edinburgh resource is found by querying the OS gazetteer search service for
          'Edinburgh' then checking the labels of the results that came up. OS give it a type of
          'NamedPlace' and give it some coordinates.</p>

        <p>This Edinburgh airport resource was also found by the same OS gazetteer search service
          for 'Edinburgh'. This is clearly not the same as the original spatial thing, but you might
          want to say something like 'within' or 'hasAirport'.</p>

        <p>This resource is in the OS 'Boundary Line' service that contains administrative and
          statistical geography areas in the UK. It's probably safe to say the original identifier
          is owl:sameAs this one.</p>

      <p><dfn data-lt="Coverage|Coverages|Coverage Function">Coverage</dfn>: A coverage is a function that describe characteristics of real-world phenomena that vary over space and/or time. Typical examples are temperature, elevation and precipitation. A coverage is typically represented as a data structure containing a set of such values, each associated with one of the elements in a spatial, temporal or spatio-temporal domain. Typical spatial domains are point sets (e.g. sensor locations), curve sets (e.g. contour lines), grids (e.g. orthoimages, elevation models), etc. A property whose value varies as a function of time may be represented as a temporal coverage or time-series. <span style="background-color:yellow">[ISO-19109] §8.8</span></p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="CRS|Coordinate Reference System">Coordinate Reference System (CRS)</dfn>: A

      <p><dfn data-lt="Geocoding|Forward geocoding|reverse geocoding">Geocoding</dfn>: Forward
        geocoding, often just referred to as geocoding, is the process of converting addresses into
        geographic coordinates. Reverse geocoding is the opposite process; converting geographic
        coordinates to addresses. <span style="background-color:yellow">Compare with the <a

      <p><dfn>Geohash</dfn>: A <a>geocoding</a> system with a hierarchical spatial data structure
        which subdivides space into buckets. Geohashes offer properties like arbitrary precision and
        the possibility of gradually removing characters from the end of the code to reduce its size
        (and gradually lose precision). As a consequence of the gradual precision degradation,
        nearby places will often (but not always) present similar prefixes. The longer a shared
        prefix is, the closer the two places are. <span style="background-color:yellow"><a

        connectivity, which enables these objects to be controlled remotely and to collect and
        exchange data.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="JavaScript Object Notation|JSON">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</dfn>: A
        lightweight, text-based, language-independent data interchange format defined in
        [[RFC7159]]. It was derived from the ECMAScript Programming Language Standard. JSON defines
        a small set of formatting rules for the portable representation of structured data.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="link|links">Link</dfn>: A a typed connection between two resources that are
        identified by Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [[RFC3987]], and is comprised
        of: (i) a context IRI, (ii) a link relation type, (iii) a target IRI, and (iv) optionally,
        target attributes. Note that in the common case, the IRI will also be a URI [[RFC3986]],
        because many protocols (such as HTTP) do not support dereferencing IRIs. <span
          style="background-color:yellow">[[RFC5988]]</span></p>
      <p><dfn>Linked data</dfn>: The term ‘Linked Data’ refers to an approach to publishing data
        that puts linking at the heart of the notion of data, and uses the linking technologies
        provided by the Web to enable the weaving of a global distributed database. <span

        assumption asserts that the truth value of a statement may be true irrespective of whether
        or not it is known to be true. This assumption codifies the informal notion that in general
        no single agent or observer has complete knowledge. In essence, from the absence of a
        statement alone, a deductive reasoner cannot (and must not) infer that the statement is
        false. <span style="background-color:yellow"><a

          (RDF)</dfn>: A directed, labeled graph data model for representing information in the Web.
        It may be serialized in a number of data formats such as N-Triples [[N-TRIPLES]], XML
        [[RDF-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR]], Terse Triple Language (“turtle” or TTL) [[TURTLE]] and JSON-LD
        [[JSON-LD]].</p>
      <p><dfn>Semantic web</dfn>: The term “Semantic Web” refers to World Wide Web Consortium's
        vision of the Web of <a>linked data</a>. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create
        data stores on the Web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data.</p>
      <p><dfn>SPARQL</dfn>: A query language for <a>RDF</a>; it can be used to express queries
        across diverse data sources. <span style="background-color:yellow"
          >[[SPARQL11-OVERVIEW]]</span></p>
      <p><dfn>Spatial data</dfn>: Data describing anything with spatial extent; i.e. size, shape or
        position. In addition to describing things that are positioned relative to the Earth (also
        see geospatial data), spatial data may also describe things using other coordinate systems
        that are not related to position on the Earth, such as the size, shape and positions of
        cellular and sub-cellular features described using the 2D or 3D cartesian coordinate system
        of a specific tissue sample.</p>
      <p><dfn>Spatial database</dfn>: A spatial database, or geodatabase, is a database that is
        optimized to store and query data that represents objects defined in a geometric space. Most
        spatial databases allow representation of simple geometric objects such as points, lines and
        polygons and provide functions to determine spatial relationships (overlaps, touches
        etc).</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="SDI|SDIs|Spatial Data Infrastructure|Spatial Data Infrastructures">SDI</dfn>:
        An ecosystem of geographic data, metadata, tools, applications, policies and users that are
        necessary to acquire, process, distribute, use, maintain, and preserve spatial data. Due to
        its nature (size, cost, number of interactors) an SDI is often government-related.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Spatial Thing|Spatial Things|SpatialThing|SpatialThings">Spatial thing</dfn>:
        Anything with spatial extent, i.e. size, shape, or position. e.g. people, places, bowling
        balls, as well as abstract regions like cubes. <span style="background-color:yellow">Compare

      <h2>Changes since previous versions</h2>
      <section>
        <h2>Changes since the first public working draft of 19 January 2016</h2>
        <p>The document has undergone substantial changes since the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-sdw-bp-20160119/">first public working draft</a>. Below are some of the changes made:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Focusing the document to suit the needs of practitioners: those either publishing spatial data themselves, or developing software tools to support the publication of spatial data (see sections <a href="#audience"></a> and <a href="#scope"></a>)</li>
          <li>Addition of new introductory material to explain the fundamentals of spatial data to readers (see sections <a href="#spatial-things-features-and-geometry"></a>, <a href="#coverages"></a>, <a href="#spatial-relations"></a>, <a href="#linked-data"></a> and <a href="#why-are-traditional-sdi-not-enough"></a>)</li>
          <li>Consolidation of the best practices from 30 down to 17 - based on merging duplicate or closely related best practices and focusing our scope only on spatial data concerns so that, for example, best practices relating to handling sensor data are removed (we expect these subjects to be included in future iterations of the Sensor Network deliverables of the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">working group</a>)</li>
          <li>Alignment of the remaining best practices with those from [[DWBP]] - including organising them according to the same sub-section headings</li>
          <li>As a consequence of the consolidation and [[DWBP]] alignment, the best practices are renumbered (although the fragment-identifiers remain unchanged from those used in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-sdw-bp-20160119/">first public working draft</a>) and the cross-reference to the Requirements from [[SDW-UCR]] (section <a href="#requirements"></a>) has been updated</li>
          <li>Addition of a new, partially complete section (see <a href="#how-to-use"></a>) that is intended to help readers understand the steps they should take and the questions they should consider when publishing spatial data on the Web; referencing both the general [[DWBP]] best practices and those specific to spatial data described in this document</li>
          <li>Improvements to the <a href="#glossary"></a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Section <a href="#narrative"></a> has also be introduced in this draft in an attempt to provide a context for the best practices using an end-to-end narrative based on an urban flooding event. This introduces a number of case studies that are intended to illustrate how the challenges associated with publishing different kinds of spatial data on the Web may be approached. This draft includes only the overview for each case study and does not (yet) describe the activities that each actor should undertake in order to publish their spatial data.</p>
