    <section id="abstract">
      <p>This document advises on best practices related to the publication and usage of spatial
        data on the Web; the use of Web technologies <em>as they may be applied to location</em>.
        The best practices are intended for practitioners, including Web developers and geospatial
        experts, and are compiled based on evidence of real-world application. These best practices
        suggest a significant change of emphasis from traditional Spatial Data Infrastructures by
        adopting a Linked Data approach. As location is often the common factor across multiple
        datasets, spatial data is an especially useful addition to the Linked Data cloud; the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">5 Stars of Linked Data</a> paradigm
        is promoted where relevant.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="sotd">
      <p>This Working Draft incorporates changes based on Working Group discussions during and since <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/09/TPAC/">TPAC 2016</a> (see <a href="#changes" class="sectionRef"></a> for details). This document is still very much a work in progress; we anticipate three further iterations of the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices before the Working Group ends in June 2017. Our aim remains to provide actionable advice and guidance to practitioners (e.g. those directly publishing spatial data on the Web themselves, or those developing software tools to assist that publication) - which means that the omission of examples in many of the best practices <em>will</em> be resolved before final publication. We intend to refer to examples “in the wild” in an effort to provide evidence that each Best Practice is being applied.</p>

      <p>Looking to future releases, the editors anticipate:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Further consolidation of best practices (there is still some overlap with [[DWBP]] to be resolved).</li>
        <li>Best practices to be reordered to help readers understand where to prioritize their efforts when publishing spatial data on the Web - which will change the numbering of the best practices.</li>
        <li>Further development of <a href="#how-to-use" class="sectionRef"></a> which is intended to provide a would-be spatial data publisher navigate through best practices from here and [[DWBP]] by presenting with questions they should consider and helping them to identify which best practices they should prioritize - only about one-quarter complete and does not yet cover topics like the choice of data format or vocabulary.</li>

      <p><strong>For <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr>:</strong> This is a Public

    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Increasing numbers of Web applications provide a means of accessing data. From simple
        visualizations to sophisticated interactive tools, there is a growing reliance on data. The
        open data movement has lead to many national, regional and local governments publishing
        their data through portals. Scientific and cultural heritage data is increasingly published
        on the Web for reuse by others. Crowd-sourced and social media data are abundant on the Web.
        Sensors, connected devices and services from domains such as energy, transport,
        manufacturing and healthcare are becoming commonly integrated using the Web as a common data
        sharing platform.</p>
      <p>The Data on the Web Best Practices [[DWBP]] provide a set of recommendations that are
        applicable to the publication of <em>all</em> types of data on the Web. Those best practices
        cover aspects including data formats, data access, data identifiers, metadata, licensing and
        provenance.</p>
      <p>Location information, or <a>spatial data</a>, is often a common thread running through
        such data; describing how things are positioned relative to the Earth in terms of
        coordinates and/or topology.</p>
      <p>Within this document our focus is the somewhat broader concern of <a>spatial data</a>; data
        that describes <em>anything</em> with spatial extent (i.e. size, shape or position) whether
        or not it is positioned relative to the Earth.</p>
      <p>Similarly to the challenges identified in [[DWBP]] relating to publishing data on the Web,
        and therefore not making use of the full potential of the Web as a data sharing platform,
        there is a lack of consistency in how people publish <a>spatial data</a>.</p>
      <p>It is not that there is a lack of spatial data on the Web; the maps, satellite and street
        level images offered by search engines are familiar and there are many more examples of
        spatial data being used in Web applications.</p>
      <aside class="example" id="ex-sfpark" title="SFpark"><a href="http://sfpark.org/">SFpark</a>
        is a Web site where users can look at a map of San Francisco to see where parking is
        available and at what price. Parking prices are incrementally raised or lowered in SFpark
        pilot areas based on demand. In this application, static data on existing parking spaces is
        combined with changing data about where people park the most, which is measured by parking
        sensors.</aside>
      <p>However, the data that has been published is difficult to find and often problematic to
        access for non-specialist users. The key problems we are trying to solve in this document
        are discoverability, accessibility and interoperability. Our overarching goal is to enable
        spatial data to be integrated within the wider Web of data; providing standard patterns and
        solution that help solve these problems.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="audience" class="informative">
      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>Our goal in writing this best practice document is to support the practitioners who are
        responsible for publishing their spatial data on the Web or developing tools to make it easy
        for others to work with spatial data.</p>
      <p>We expect readers to be familiar both with the fundamental concepts of the architecture of
        the Web [[WEBARCH]] and the generalized best practices related to the publication and usage
        of data on the Web [[DWBP]].</p>
      <p>We aim to provide two primary pathways into these best practices:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>for those already familiar with publishing data on the Web who want to better exploit
          the spatial aspects of their data; and</li>
        <li>for those who publish spatial data through Spatial Data Infrastructures and want to
          better integrate that data within the wider Web ecosystem.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In each case, we aim to help them provide incremental value to their data through
        application of these best practices.</p>
      <p>This document provides a wide range of examples that illustrate how these best practices
        may be applied using specific technologies. We do not expect readers to be familiar with all
        the technologies used herein; rather that readers can identify with the activities being
        undertaken in the various examples and, in doing so, find relevant technologies that they
        are already aware of or discover technologies that are new them.</p>
      <p>In this document we focus on the needs of data publishers and the developers that provide
        tools for them. That said, we recognize that value can only be gained from
          <em>publishing</em> the spatial data when people <em>use</em> it! Although we do not
        directly address the needs of those users, we ask that data publishers and developers
        reading this document do not forget about them; moreover, that they always consider the
        needs of users when publishing spatial data or developing the supporting tools. All of our
        best practices are intended to provide guidance about the publishing spatial data to improve
        ease of use. As we said above: the key problems we are trying to solve in this document are
        discoverability, accessibility and interoperability. We hope that the examples included in
        the urban flooding scenario will help illustrate how users may benefit from the application
        of these best practices.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="scope" class="informative">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>All of the best practices described in [[DWBP]] are relevant to publication of spatial data
        on the Web. Some, such as [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#DataLicense">Best Practice 4: Provide data license information</a> 
        need no further elaboration in the context of <a>spatial data</a>.
        However, other best practices from [[DWBP]] are further refined in this document to provide
        more specific guidance for <a>spatial data</a>.</p>
      <p>The best practices described below are intended to meet requirements derived from the
        scenarios in [[SDW-UCR]] that describe how spatial data in commonly published and used on
        the Web.</p>
      <p>In line with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter#bp">charter</a>, this
        document provides advice on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The choice of ontology and data format to be used when encoding spatial data;</li>
        <li>The use of URIs for identifiers of resources described in spatial data;</li>
        <li>The use of metadata to complement spatial data; and</li>
        <li>The use of APIs to expose spatial data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As stated in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter#bp">charter</a>, discussion of activities relating to rending spatial data as maps is explicitly out of scope.</p>
      <p>We extend [[DWBP]] to cover aspects specifically relating to <a>spatial data</a>,
        introducing new best practices only where necessary. In particular, we consider the
        individual resources, or <a>Spatial Things</a>, that are described within a dataset.</p>
      <p>We consider a ‘programmable web’, formed by a network of connected services, products, data
        and devices, each doing what it is good at, to be the future of the Web. So whether we are
        talking about Big, Crawlable, Linked, Open, Closed, Small, Spatial or Structured Data; our
        starting point is that it needs to be machine-friendly and developer-friendly: making it as
        programmable as possible.</p>
      <p>There are many situations where the location of a person is very useful; from using a taxi hailing service to geocoding a selfie. Technology makes this location information easy to collect and share. However, spatial data has particular characteristics which makes its use potentially more complex. For example a single location of an anonymous tracked mobile phone may cause few privacy concerns, however the same phone tracked over a few days could provide enough information to make the identification of it's user possible. Like all personally identifiable information, great care must be taken as the collection, management and security of such information is the subject of legal frameworks. We do not attempt to provide guidance as to legal aspects of storing potentially personally identifiable spatial information, expert legal advice should be obtained. In summary: legal and privacy considerations relating to spatial data are out of scope.</p>
      <p>The best practices described in this document are compiled based on evidence of real-world
        application. Where the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">Working
          Group</a> have identified issues that inhibit the use or interoperability of spatial data
        on the Web, yet no evidence of real-world application is available, the editors present
        these issues to the reader for consideration, along with any approaches recommended by the
        Working Group. Such recommendations will be clearly distinguished as such in order to ensure
        that they are not confused with evidence-based best practice.</p>
      <p class="issue" data-number="81">Devise a way to make best versus emerging practices clearly
        recognizable in this document.</p>
      <p>The normative element of each best practice is the <em>intended outcome</em>. Possible
        implementations are suggested and, where appropriate, these recommend the use of a
        particular technology.</p>
      <p>We intend this best practice to be durable; that is that the best practices remain relevant
        for many years to come as the specific technologies change. However, in order to provide
        actionable guidance, i.e. to provide readers with the technical information they need to get
        their spatial data on the Web, we try to balance between durable advice (that is necessarily
        general) and examples using currently available technologies that illustrate how these best
        practices can be implemented. We expect that readers will continue to be able to derive
        insight from the examples even when those specifically mentioned technologies are no longer
        in common usage, understanding that technology ‘y’ has replaced technology ‘x’.</p>

      <h2>Best Practices Summary</h2>
      <p>This document contains a variety of best practices related to the publication and usage of spatial data on the Web. First, it continues with several more in-depth introductions on spatial things and geometry, coverages, spatial relations, coordinate reference systems, linked data, and Spatial Data Infrastructures. Then it describes how these best practices can be used, depending on your starting point and context. After that, the best practices themselves are described. They are about metadata, quality, versioning, identifiers, vocabularies, (API) access, linking, and large datasets. </p>
      <p>The following best practices can be found in this document:</p>

      <h2>Spatial Things, Features and Geometry</h2>
      <p>In spatial data standards from the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org">Open
          Geospatial Consortium</a> (OGC) and the 19100 series of ISO geographic information
        standards from <a href="http://www.isotc211.org">ISO/TC 211</a> the primary entity is the
          <a>feature</a>. [[ISO-19101]] defines a feature
        as an: “abstraction of real world phenomena”.</p>
      <p>This terse definition is a little confusing, so let’s unpack it.</p>
      <p>Firstly, it talks about “real world phenomena”; that’s everything from highways to
        helicopters, parking meters to postcode areas, water bodies to weather fronts and more.
        These can be physical things that you can touch (e.g. a phone box) or an abstract concept
        that has spatial extent (e.g. a postcode area). Features can even be fictional (e.g.
        “Dickensian London”) and may even lack any concrete location information such as the
        mythical Atlantis.</p>
      <p>The key point is that these “features” are things that one talks about in the <a>universe
          of discourse</a> - which is defined in [[ISO-19101]] as the “view of the real or hypothetical world that includes
        everything of interest”.</p>
      <p>Secondly, the definition of feature talks about “abstraction”. Take the example of <a
          href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q546122">Eddystone Lighthouse</a>. A helicopter pilot
        might see it a “vertical obstruction” and be interested in attributes such as its height and
        precise location. Whereas a sailor may see it as a “maritime navigation aid” and need
        information about its light characteristic and general location. Depending on one’s set of
        concerns, only a subset of the attributes of a given “real world phenomenon” are relevant.
        In the case of Eddystone Lighthouse, we defined two separate “abstractions”. As is common
        practice in many information modelling activities, the common sets of attributes for a given
        “abstraction” are used to define <em>classes</em>. In the parlance of [[ISO-19101]], such a class is known as “feature
        type”. </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Although the exact semantics differ a little, there is a good correlation between the
          concept of “feature type” as defined in spatial data standards and the concept
          of “class” defined in [[RDF-SCHEMA]]. The former is an information modelling construct that
          binds a fixed set of attributes to an identified resource, whereas the latter defines the
          set of all resources that share the same group of attributes.</p>
        <p>When combined with the <a>open-world assumption</a> embraced by RDF Schema and the Web
          Ontology Language (OWL) [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]], the set-based approach to classes provides more
          flexibility when combining information from multiple sources. For example, the “Eddystone
          Lighthouse” resource can be seen as <em>both</em> a “vertical obstruction” <em>and</em> a
          “maritime navigation aid” as it meets the criteria for membership of both sets.
          Conversely, this flexibility makes it much more difficult to build software applications
          as there is no guarantee that an information resource will specify a given attribute. Web
          standards such the Shapes Constraint Language [[SHACL]] are being defined to remedy this
          issue.</p>
      </div>
      <p>However, the term “feature” is also commonly used to mean a capability of a system, application or component. Also, in some domains and/or applications no distinction is made between "<a>feature</a>" and the corresponding real-world phenomena.</p>

      <p>To avoid confusion, we adopt the term “<a>spatial thing</a>” throughout the remainder of this best practice document. “<a>Spatial thing</a>” is defined in [[W3C-BASIC-GEO]] as “Anything with spatial extent, i.e. size, shape, or position. e.g. people, places, bowling balls, as well as abstract areas like cubes”.</p>

      <p>The concept of “<a>spatial thing</a>” is considered to include <em>both</em> "real-world phenomena" <em>and</em> their abstractions (e.g. “<a>feature</a>” as defined in [[ISO-19101]]). Furthermore, we treat it as inclusive of other commonly used definitions; e.g. <strong>Feature</strong> from [[NeoGeo]], described as “A geographical feature, capable of holding spatial relations”.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>A <a>spatial thing</a> may move. We must take care not to oversimplify our concept of <a>spatial thing</a> by assuming that it is equivalent to definitions such as <strong>Location</strong> (from [[DCTERMS]]) or <strong>Place</strong> (from [[SCHEMA-ORG]]), which are respectively described as “A spatial region or named place” and "Entities that have a somewhat fixed, physical extension".</p>

      <p>Furthermore, these geometries may be subject to change due to, say, a resurvey of the

        practices presented below, we use a HTTP URI to unambiguously identify Eddystone Lighthouse:

    <section id="coverages">
      <h2>Coverages: describing properties that vary with location (and time)</h2>
      <p>Many aspects of <a>spatial things</a> can be described with single-valued, static properties. However, in some applications it is more useful to describe the variation of property values in space and time. Such descriptions are formalized as <a>coverages</a>. Users of spatial information may employ both viewpoints.</p>

      <p>So what is a <a>coverage</a>? As defined by [[ISO-19123]] it is simply a data structure that maps points in space and time to property values. For example, an aerial photograph can be thought of as a coverage that maps positions on the ground to colors. A river gauge maps points in time to flow values. A weather forecast maps points in space and time to values of temperature, wind speed, humidity and so forth. One way to think of a coverage is as a mathematical function, where data values are a function of coordinates in space and time.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>Sometimes you’ll hear the word “coverage” used synonymously with “gridded data” or “raster data” but this isn’t really accurate. You can see from the above paragraph that non-gridded data (like a river gauge measurement) can also be modelled as coverages. Nevertheless, you will often find a bias toward gridded data in discussions (and software) that concern coverages.</p>
      </div>

      <p>A coverage is not itself a <a>spatial thing</a>. The definition above presents a coverage as a data construct - in which case, it does not exist in the real world. Accordingly, we might say in the hydrology example, where a river gauge measures flow values at regular sampling times, that the “river segment” (a spatial thing) has a property “flow rate” that is expressed as coverage data.</p>

      <p><a>Spatial things</a> and <a>coverages</a> may be related in several ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>signals in coverages may be used to provide the evidence for the existence, location and type of spatial things; for example, within a geophysical borehole the variation in soil/rock type may be used to infer the presence of particular rock-units at underground locations</li>
        <li>as the property value of a spatial thing whose value varies within the extent of that spatial thing; for example, the varying strength of mobile-network coverage throughout the UK</li>
        <li>the values of a common property for a distributed set of spatial things provide a discrete sampling of a coverage; for example, the measurement of soil moisture based at a set of sampling stations can be compiled to show the spatial variation of soil moisture across the region where the sampling stations are located</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A coverage can be defined using three main pieces of information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <em>domain</em> of the coverage is the set of points in space and time for which we have data values. For example, in a river gauge measurement, the domain is the set of times at which the flow was measured. In a satellite image, the domain is the set of pixels. In a weather forecast, the domain is a set of grid cells.</li>
        <li>The <em>range</em> of the coverage is the set of measured, simulated or observed data values. A single coverage may record values for lots of different quantities; for example a weather forecast predicts values for many things (temperature, humidity etc.) on the same domain. So the range of a coverage often consists of a number of lists of data values, one for each measured variable. Each element within each list corresponds with one of the elements of the domain (e.g. a pixel or grid cell).</li>
        <li>The <em>range metadata</em> describes the range of the coverage, to help users to understand what the data values mean. This may include links to definitions of variables, units of measure and other bits of useful information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Usually, the most complex piece of information in the coverage is the definition of the domain. This can vary quite widely from coverage type to coverage type, as the list above shows. For this reason, coverages are often defined by the spatiotemporal geometry of their domain. You will hear people talking about “multidimensional grid coverages” or “time-series coverages” or “vertical profile coverages” for example.</p>

    <section id="spatial-relations">
      <h2>Spatial relations</h2>
      <p>A spatial relation specifies how an object is located in space in relation to a reference
        object. Commonly used types of spatial relations are: topological, directional and distance
        relations.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Topological relations</em> describe the relationships between geometric objects that
          are invariant to rotation, translation and scaling. As such, topological relations can
          support qualitative spatial reasoning without reference to the geometries themselves; for
          example to assert that object A touches object B. These relations, also known as “spatial
          predicates”, include concepts such as: equals, disjoint, intersects, touches, within,
          contains, overlaps and crosses.</li>
        <li><em>Directional relations</em> specify the relative direction between object and
          reference. Examples include: left, in front of and astern.</li>
        <li><em>Distance relations</em> specify how far the object is from the reference object.
          Examples include: at, nearby and far away.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="issue" data-number="383">

            <a>spatial things</a> and geometries?</p>

      <h2>Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)</h2>

      <div class="issue" data-number="392">
        <p>Introduction to CRS does not yet cover non-geographic cases.</p>
        <p>Best Practice scope is "spatial data" - which includes non-geographic location (e.g. where things aren't positioned relative to the Earth). For example, we have a microscopy use case where the locations of cells are described.</p>
      </div>

      <p>One of the most fundamental aspects of publishing spatial data, data about location, is how to express and share the location in a consistent way. In almost all cases where you are publishing data for use by the wider web community the use of <a>latitude</a> and <a>longitude</a> coordinates (Lat and Long) is most appropriate. Latitude and longitude coordinates are global and offer a level of precision well suited to many applications: you can express a location to within a few metres which is perfect for locating your favorite coffee shop, geocoding a photograph or capturing an augmented reality Pokemon hiding in your local park.  </p>
      
      <p>As with everything to do with spatial data, things can get more complicated. One of the most common problems occurs because not all <a>Coordinate Reference Systems</a> (CRS) agree how to express latitude and longitude coordinates. Some CRS order the coordinates <em>Lat/Long</em> while others use <em>Long/Lat</em>; some use <em>decimal degrees</em> while others use <em>degrees, minutes and seconds</em> (<em>dms</em>). Axis order mistakes can mean the difference between, say, a position in the Netherlands or somewhere in Somalia, while encoding coordinates in <em>decimal degrees</em> when <em>dms</em> is expected can lead to positional errors on the kilometer scale.  </p>
      
      <p>Therefore it is very important to provide explicit information to your users about how coordinates are encoded. For example, this snippet of results from the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro">Google Geocoding API</a> makes explicit which is the latitude and which is the longitude coordinate. </p>

      <pre class="example" title="A Google Geocoding API result snippet">
 "formatted_address" : "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA",
         "geometry" : {
            "location" : {
               "lat" : 37.4224764,
               "lng" : -122.0842499
            },
            "location_type" : "ROOFTOP",
            "viewport" : {
               "northeast" : {
                  "lat" : 37.4238253802915,
                  "lng" : -122.0829009197085
               },
               "southwest" : {
                  "lat" : 37.4211274197085,

               }
            }
         },
      </pre>
      
      <p>Other mechanisms include using a data format that specifies how the coordinates are included (such as GeoJSON [[RFC7946]] where section <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-4">4. Coordinate Reference System</a> specifies coordinate order of longitude and latitude using units of decimal degrees) or by having your data explicitly reference the CRS definition you're using. See <a href="#bp-crs" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 17: State how coordinate values are encoded</a> for more information.</p>

      <p>Users of spatial data are often interested in the third dimesion too: vertical elevation (or altitude). For most situations, we can consider elevation to be the vertical distance above (or below) mean sea level. The elevation is most often expressed in meters (but this can vary between CRS definititions) and is provided as a third value in a coordinate position.</p>

      <p>The following is a little more technical; and in most cases this should only be for information.</p> 
      
      <p>Latitude, longitude and elevation measurements express a position on the surface of the Earth. But to define this position we need to state where we are making the measurements from (e.g. the equator, the prime meridian and the approximated surface of the Earth, or <a>geoid</a>) and consider the shape of the earth (a flattened sphere with lumps and bumps, but for convenient mathematical operations, usually approximated to an <a>ellipsoid</a>). This information is used to define the geodetic datum which provides the basis of every Coordinate Reference System.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">World Geodetic System 1984</a> (<strong>WGS 84</strong>) Coordinate Reference System is used in almost all cases where spatial data is published on the Web. Since this is also used by the GPS system, it's handy for all those mobile Apps! </p>

      <p>Most people can stop reading now, but of course there are going to be a few cases where WGS 84 is not appropriate.</p>
      
      <p>In many parts of the world location data has been collected using local coordinate systems that are specific to particular countries or regions. These local coordinate systems may use  projected measurements defined on a flat, two-dimensional surface (which are easier to use for calculating distances than angular measurements and are essential when making topographic maps).</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>Users of spatial data should be aware that projected coordinate systems distort distances and angular measurements and accoringly affect how <a href="http://thetruesize.com">the true size</a> of countries of countries and other large-scale entities is perceived. CNN explore some of the challenges relating to map projections in their article <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/18/africa/real-size-of-africa/">What's the real size of Africa?</a>.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>So it may be that you have information in a projected CRS, rather than global latitude and longitude - what should you do? You can publish data as is in one of these many projected CRS, but you need to tell users which particular CRS is being used. A good directory of Coordinate Reference Systems is maintained by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers: the <a href="http://www.epsg.org/">EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset</a>. </p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>It is common for a CRS to be described by its ESPG code. For example, 2-dimensional WGS 84 (Lat/Long) is <a href="http://epsg.io/4326">EPSG:4326</a>, 3-dimensional WGS 84 (Lat/Long/Elevation) <a href="http://epsg.io/4979">EPSG:4979</a>, Web-Mercator (a global projected CRS used in most Web-mapping applications) is <a href="http://epsg.io/3857">EPSG:3857</a> and OSGB 1936 / British National Grid (a national projected CRS) is <a href="http://epsg.io/27700">EPSG:27700</a>. </p>
        <p>Definitions of coordinate reference systems are available from the <a href="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/">Open Geospatial Consotium CRS Register</a>, <a href="http://spatialreference.org/">Spatial Reference</a> and <a href="http://epsg.io/">EPSG.io</a> (an open-source web service which simplifies discovery of coordinate reference systems utilized worldwide).</p>
      </div>  
      
      <p>Alternatively you can re-project your coordinates to WGS 84 using many available tools online. So for example the location at <code>516076, 170953</code> in British National Grid (<a href="http://epsg.io/27700">EPSG:27700</a>) coordinates is <code>-0.331841, 51.425708</code> in WGS 84 Long/Lat. This conversion is a useful step as it makes you data more accessible to global users. So if you can do so, it is helpful to publish data in both local (projected) and global coordinates. </p>      
      
      <p>Re-projecting to a better known CRS is also a necessary step if you are publishing data in the form of engineering or Computer Aided Design (CAD)  drawings of a new building or road layout for example. Usually these drawings are made using a very local coordinate reference system for the site itself, so the data will need to be reprojected to “fit” with existing data.</p>
      
      <p>So we are now at the point where almost everyone publishing spatial data on the Web can stop reading. But for those with specific requirements concerning high precision locations, there are a few more topics that need to be mentioned.</p>

      <p>If you need to be able to measure in terms of a few centimetres or less then things are more complicated.  With this level of precision required you need to take into account a more sophisticated model of the shape of the Earth and take into account plate tectonics.  </p>

      <p>For these more complex use cases other reference systems with alternative geodetic datums are used. The geodetic datum can be thought of as the model of the Earth's surface over which the coordinate reference system is applied. Different datums use different models for the precise <em>shape</em> and <em>size</em> of the Earth in order to provide more accurate horizontal or vertical measurements at different positions on the globe (because depending on your location, different <a>ellipsoids</a> will provide a better approximation of the local Earth's surface - but this is at the expense of a poorer match elsewhere).</p> 

      <p>While WGS 84 provides a <em>reasonable</em> fit at all points on the Earth's surface, many other datums are defined for improved fit within a regional or national area. For example in Europe a system called ETRS89 (<a href="http://epsg.io/4258">EPSG:4258</a>) can be used instead of WGS 84, while in North America a similar system called NAD-83 (<a href="http://epsg.io/4269">EPSG:4269</a>) is used.  So it might be that you have measurements made using these reference systems. Here the best practice is once more to be explicit in describing the CRS used, but also to be careful re-projecting to different systems as required accuracy may be lost.</p>
      
      <p>Finally another issue is that points on the surface of the earth are actually moving relative to the coordinate system, due to geologic processes. You may think this is of interest only to geologists, but when I tell you that Australia has moved around 1.5m since the framework was last reset 20 years ago, and remind you that we are entering the age of self-driving cars, then you will probably think again. Re-calculating the datum from time to time, or maybe continuously such as in the case of the dynamic New Zealand Geodetic Datum (NZGD2000), really does matter for some applications. See <a href="#bp-crs-choice" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 3: Choose the coordinate reference system to suit your user's applications</a> for more information.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>Detailed discussion of coordinate reference system definitions themselves is beyond the scope of this best practice document. Should this topic be of interest, please refer to specialist documentation such as [[OGC-TOPIC-2]] / [[ISO-19111]].</p>

      <h2>Linked Data</h2>
      <p>The term ‘Linked Data’ refers to an approach to publishing data that puts linking at
        the heart of the notion of data, and uses the linking technologies provided by the Web to
        enable the weaving of a global distributed database. By naming real world entities - be they
        web resources, physical objects such as the Eiffel Tower, or even more abstract things such
        as relations or concepts - with URLs data can be published and linked in the same way web
        pages can. [[LDP-PRIMER]]</p>
      <p>The 5-star scheme at <a href="http://5stardata.info">5 Star Data</a> states:</p>
      <p style="text-indent:80px">&#9733; make your stuff available on the Web (whatever format)
        under an open license</p>
      <p style="text-indent:65px">&#9733;&#9733; make it available as structured data (e.g., Excel
        instead of image scan of a table)</p>
      <p style="text-indent:50px">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; make it available in a non-proprietary open
        format (e.g., CSV as well as of Excel)</p>
      <p style="text-indent:35px">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; use URIs to denote things, so that
        people can point at your stuff</p>
      <p style="text-indent:20px">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; link your data to other data
        to provide context</p>
      <p>We think that the concept of <a>Linked Data</a> is fundamental to the publishing of spatial
        data on the Web: it is the <a>links</a> that connect data together that are the foundational
        to the Web of data.</p>
      <p>These best practices promote a Linked Data approach.</p>
      <p>Sources such as the Best Practices for Publishing Linked Data [[LD-BP]] assert a strong
        association between Linked Data and the <a>Resource Description Framework</a> (RDF)
        [[RDF11-PRIMER]]. Yet we believe that Linked Data requires only that the formats used to
        publish data support Web linking (see [[WEBARCH]] <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#hypertext">§4.4 Hypertext</a>). <a href="http://5stardata.info">5 Star Data</a> (based on [[5STAR-LOD]])
        asserts only that data formats be open and non-proprietary (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;); and
        infers the need for data formats to support use of URIs as identifiers
        (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;) and Web linking (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;).</p>
      <p>Within this document we include examples that use <a>RDF</a> and related technologies such
        as <a>triple stores</a> and <a>SPARQL</a> because we see evidence of its use in real world
        applications that support <a>Linked Data</a>. However, we must make clear to readers that
        there is no requirement for all publishers of spatial data on the Web to embrace the wider
        suite of technologies associated with the Semantic Web; we recognize that in many cases, a
        Web developer has little or no interest in the toolchains associated with Semantic Web due
        to the addition of complexity to any Web-centric solution.</p>
      <p>Although we think that <a>Linked Data</a> need not necessarily require the use of
          <a>RDF</a>, it is probably the most commonly representation. We note that [[JSON-LD]] provides a bridge
        between those worlds by providing a data format that is compatible with RDF but relies on
        standard <a>JSON</a> tooling.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, as the examples in this document illustrate, we often see a ‘hybrid’ approach
        being used in real-world applications; using <a>RDF</a> to work with graphs of information
        that interlink resources, while relying on other technologies to query and process the
        spatial aspects of that information for performance reasons.</p>

          some kind of query to access data. Often these queries are complex to define, requiring in
          depth knowledge both of the data structure and the domain-specific query language.</li>
        <li>In addition, it is often difficult for non-expert users to understand and use the data.
          Part of this are domain-specific complexities that are difficult for non-experts (e.g.,
          handling of coordinates in different coordinate reference systems), but hard to avoid
          entirely. But the datasets often address requirements of expert communities with diverse
          needs, resulting in comprehensive, but complex specifications that cover many edge cases,
          too. And the data is typically available in formats that are not easy to process for
          non-expert users.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, <a>spatial data infrastructures</a> are a key component of the broader <a>spatial
          data</a> ecosystem. Such infrastructures typically include workflows and tools related to
        the management and curation of spatial datasets, and provide mechanism to support the rich
        set of capabilities required by the expert community. Our goal is to help spatial data
        publishers build on these foundations to enable the spatial data from SDIs to be fully
        integrated with the Web of data.</p>
      <p>When your starting point is a <a>spatial data infrastructure</a>, you should at least read the following best practices. These provide the most important extra steps that should be taken in order to bring spatial data from <a>spatial data infrastructures</a> to the Web: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#indexable-by-search-engines">Best Practice 4: Make your spatial data indexable by search engines</a></li>
        <li><a href="#globally-unique-ids">Best Practice 7: Use globally unique persistent HTTP URIs for spatial things</a></li>
        <li><a href="#convenience-apis">Best Practice 11: Expose spatial data through 'convenience APIs'</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The rest of the best practices provide more detail on specific aspects of publishing spatial data on the Web, such as metadata, geometries, CRS information, versioned data, and so on.</p>

      <h2>How to use these best practices</h2>
      <div class="issue" data-number="381">
        <p>Section <a href="#how-to-use"></a> is incomplete.</p>
        <p>Estimate that this covers only a quarter of the "spatial data publication pathway" that we are trying to help would-be spatial data publishers navigate. More material to be added describing the full range of considerations when publishing spatial data on the Web in the next public draft.</p>
      </div>
      <section id="starting-points">
        <h3>What are the starting points?</h3>
        <p>Preparations for publishing spatial data on the Web need to start somewhere. Typically, your spatial data will be in the following places:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>plain text documents; e.g. historical texts, government reports, blog posts etc.</li>
          <li>data files containing structured content or markup; e.g. geospatial vector data in Shapefile or GML format, statistical data in tabular CSV format or a spreadsheet, as GPX data with “waypoints” and “tracks”, satellite imagery in GeoTIFF, climate simulations in CF-NetCDF etc.</li>
          <li>a data repository; e.g. PostGIS (a spatially enabled relational database), Elasticsearch (a document-oriented noSQL repository based on Apache Lucene), Apache Jena’s TDB (an RDF triple store)</li>
          <li>exposed via an existing API; including OGC-compliant web services such as WFS and WCS</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If your spatial data is managed within a software system it is likely that you will be able to access that data through one or more of the methods identified above; as structured data from a bulk extract (e.g. a “data dump”), via direct access to the underpinning data repository or through a bespoke or standards-compliant API provided by the system.</p>
        <p>As working with specific spatial data management systems is beyond the scope of this best practice document we will assume that one of the four methods identified above is your starting point.</p>
        <p>Each of these starting points have their own challenges, but working with plain text documents can be particularly tricky as you will need to parse the natural language to identify the spatial things and their properties before you can proceed any further. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is also beyond the scope of this best practice document - so we will assume that you’ve already completed this step and have parsed any plain documents into structured data records of some kind.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="what-r-u-talking-about">
        <h3>What are you talking about?</h3>
        <p>The Web is an information space in which the items of interest, referred to as resources, are identified by URIs ([[WEBARCH]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#intro">§1. Introduction</a>). The spatial data you want to publish is one such <strong>resource</strong>. Depending on the nature of your spatial data, it may be a single <strong>dataset</strong> or a collection of datasets. [[VOCAB-DCAT]] provides a useful definition of dataset: “A collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more formats.”</p>

        <p>Deciding whether your spatial data is a single dataset or not is somewhat arbitrary. To decide this, it is often useful to consider attributes such as the license under which the data will be made available, the refresh or publication schedules, the quality of the data and the governance regime applied in managing the data. Typically, all of these attributes should be consistent within a single dataset.</p>

        <p>As a first step in publishing your spatial data on the Web, we need to stitch your data into the Web’s information space by assigning a URI to each dataset (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#UniqueIdentifiers">Best Practice 9: Use persistent URIs as identifiers of datasets</a>). Furthermore, if you anticipate your data changing over time and you want users to be able to refer to a particular version of your dataset you should also consider assigning a URI to each version of the dataset (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#VersionIdentifiers">Best Practice 11: Assign URIs to dataset versions and series</a>).</p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#dataVersioning">section 8.6 Data Versioning</a> provides further guidance on working with versioned resources: providing metadata to indicate the particular version of a given dataset resource (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#VersioningInfo">Best Practice 7: Provide a version indicator</a>) and enabling users to browse the history of your dataset (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#VersionHistory">Best Practice 8: Provide version history</a>).</p>
        </div>

        <p>We also need to look inside the datasets at the resources described within your data. If you want these resources to be visible within the Web’s information space, by which we mean that others can refer to or talk about those resources, then they must also be assigned URIs (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#identifiersWithinDatasets">Best Practice 10: Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets</a>). These URIs are like 'Web-scale foreign keys' that enable information from different sources to be stitched together.</p>

        <p>In spatial data, our primary concern is always the spatial things; these are the things with spatial extent (i.e. size, shape, or position) that we talk about in our data - anything from physical things like people, places and post boxes to abstractions such as administrative areas. Spatial things should always be assigned URIs (see <a href="#globally-unique-ids">Best Practice 7: Use globally unique persistent HTTP URIs for spatial things</a>) - potentially reusing existing URIs that are already in common usage. A common pattern used when assigning URIs to spatial things is append the locally-scoped identifiers used within the dataset to a URI path within an internet DNS domain where one has administrative rights to publish content.</p>

        <p>Depending on how you organize your data, it may also be helpful to give your geometry objects URIs. For example, you may want to reuse a line string when describing the boundaries of adjacent administrative areas, or you may need to serve geometry data from an alternate URL because property data and geometry data are managed in different systems. Essentially, if you want to refer to a resource on the Web, you need to assign a URI to it.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="who-is-your-audience">
        <h3>Who is your audience?</h3>
        <p>Once you have determined the subjects of your spatial data, you should then consider your users - and the software tools, applications and capabilities they might have at their disposal.</p>

        <p>Your objective should be to reduce the “friction” created for users to work with your data by providing it in a form that is closest to what their chosen software environment supports.</p>

        <p>It is likely that you will be able to identify your intended “community of use” - and on that basis discern how best to publish data for them. However, increasingly data is being repurposed to derive insight in ways that the original publisher had never foreseen. This “unanticipated re-use” can add significant value to your data (e.g. because you didn’t know that your data could be used that way!) but this introduces the challenge of working with a large set of unknown users, developers and devices.</p>

        <p>So while you should always prioritize your known users when publishing spatial data on the Web (often, because they are your stakeholders and their happiness can lead to continued funding!), it will often reap dividends to “design for the masses”: providing your spatial data in a way that is most readily usable with the (geo)spatial JavaScript libraries commonly employed across the Web.</p>

        <p>Things that you should consider when choosing how to publish your spatial data on the Web are described next …</p>
      </section>
      <section id="parse-that">
        <h3>Parse that!</h3>
        <p>For users to work with your data, software agents (a.k.a. the “machines”) need to be able to parse it - to resolve the serialized data into its component parts. You should make your data available in machine-readable, standardized data formats (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#MachineReadableStandardizedFormat">Best Practice 12: Use machine-readable standardized data formats</a>); e.g. JSON [[RFC7159]], XML [[XML11]], CSV [[RFC4180]] and other tabular data formats, YAML [[YAML]], protocol-buffers [[PROTO3]] etc. According to the 5 Star Data [[5STAR-LOD]] scheme, using open and non-proprietary structured data formats yields a 3-star rating (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;), so you’re well on your way to good practice.</p>

        <p>Consider that Web applications are most often written in JavaScript, probably the most “frictionless” data format for Web developers is JSON. That said, it is reasonably simple to parse other formats for use in JavaScript using widely available libraries. In some cases, there are even standards to define how this should be done (for example: [[CSV2JSON]])</p>

        <p>You should also consider whether there are any attributes of these machine-readable standardized data formats that offset a little inconvenience for your data user. For example, protocol-buffers [[PROTO3]] and <abbr title="Concise Binary Object Representation">CBOR</abbr> [[RFC7049]] (“Concise Binary Object Representation”) provide a significantly more compact encoding than JSON. The inconvenience of having to use additional libraries to parse these binary formats is offset by the convenience of much faster load times.</p>

        <p>Imagery formats JPEG [[JPEG2000]] and PNG [[PNG]] can also be coerced to carry data; providing 3 or 4 channels of 8-bit data values. This can be an attractive way to encode gridded coverage data values as it is highly compact. So long as you don’t apply compression algorithms to the “image”; while compression retains visual integrity, it can ruin your data integrity. Experience indicates that network providers often do apply compression to image formats - even if you don’t want that. The key point is to ensure that you choose formats that are unaffected by the transport network.</p>

        <p>When selecting the data format, make sure that your community of use have access to libraries or other software components required to work with that format. Let’s take [[GeoTIFF]] as an “anti-example”: it’s the <i>de facto</i> format for encoding geo-referenced imagery data - such as that available from satellites - but the lack of widely available libraries for working with it in a JavaScript application make it unsuitable for publishing spatial data on the Web. Although a developer could write a byte-level parser, it puts an additional burden on any re-use.</p>

        <h3>Spatial Metadata</h3>
        <p>[[DWBP]] provides best practices discussing the provision of metadata to support
          discovery and reuse of data (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#metadata"
            >section 8.2 Metadata</a> for more details). Providing metadata at the <em>dataset</em> level
          supports a mode of discovery well aligned with the practices used in <a>Spatial Data
            Infrastructure</a> (SDI) where a user begins their search for spatial data by submitting
          a query to a catalog. Once the appropriate dataset has been located, the information
          provided by the catalog enables the user to find a service end-point from which to access
          the data itself - which may be as simple as providing a mechanism to download the entire
          dataset for local usage or may provide a rich API enabling the users to request only the
          required parts for their needs. The dataset-level metadata is used by the catalog to match
          the appropriate dataset(s) with the user's query.</p>
        <p>This section includes best practices for including the spatial extent and the CRS of the
          dataset in the metadata. These are the extra metadata items needed to make spatial
          datasets discoverable and reusable. A third best practice in this section helps you go a
          step further: exposing spatial data on the web in such a way that the individual entities
          within the dataset are discoverable. </p>

            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>For spatial data, it is often necessary to describe the spatial details of the
              dataset - such as spatial coverage or extent of the dataset or, put in simpler terms,
              which area of the world the data is about. This information is used, for example, by
                <a>SDI</a> catalog services that offer spatial querying to find data - but also by
              users to understand the nature of the dataset. In some cases, for example when dealing with crowd-sourced data, provenance information is important as well. </p>

          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>When publishing a dataset, provide as much spatial metadata as necessary, but at least the spatial coverage.
              Other examples of spatial metadata are: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>number of dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D)</li>
              <li>spatial representation type (e.g. grid, vector, text table)</li>
              <li>positioning system used for acquiring location</li>
              <li>Coordinate Reference System(s) - refer to <a href="#CRS-background" class="sectionRef"></a> for an introduction to that topic</li>

            </ul>
            <p>In Spatial Data Infrastructures the accepted standard for describing metadata is
              [[ISO-19115]]. </p>
            <p>To provide information about the spatial attributes of the dataset on the web one
              can: </p>

              <li>As shown in [[DWBP]] <a
              href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#DescriptiveMetadata">Best Practice 2: Provide descriptive metadata</a>:
                Include the spatial coverage of the features described by the dataset using
                [[VOCAB-DCAT]] and a reference to a named place in a common vocabulary for
                geospatial semantics (e.g. <a
                  href="http://www.geonames.org/ontology/documentation.html">GeoNames</a>), </li>
              <li>Again, use [[VOCAB-DCAT]], but instead of a reference to a named place, use a set
                of coordinates to specify the boundaries of the area either as a bounding box (add
                glossary ref) or a polygon.</li>
              <li>Use the spatial extension of [[VOCAB-DCAT]], [[GeoDCAT-AP]], to specify spatial
                attributes that are not available in [[VOCAB-DCAT]]. [[GeoDCAT-AP]] provides an RDF
                syntax binding for the metadata elements defined in the core profile of [[ISO-19115]]
                and in the INSPIRE metadata schema [[INSPIRE-MD]].</li>
              <li>Use geospatial ontologies (see W3C Geospatial Incubator Group (GeoXG)'s <a

          <p class="practicedesc">Consider your user's intended application when choosing the coordinate reference system(s) used to publish spatial data. </p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>A multitude of <a>coordinate reference systems</a> exist because there is no perfect solution to meet all requirements:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>The Earth is a complicated shape (neither spherical nor flat!):</p>
                <p>For each (Earth-based) coordinate reference system, the topographical surface of the Earth is approximated to a <em>geodetic datum</em> that is described using an <a>ellipsoid</a>. The trouble with approximation is that nothing is perfect everywhere, which means that compromise is inevitable. Some datums, like WGS 84, provide a reasonable (but not highly accurate) fit everywhere on the Earth, while other datums (such as the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 - as used by <a href="http://epsg.io/4258">ETRS89 / EPSG:4258</a>) provide a better fit in a given region at the expense of accuracy elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Spatial data is often <em>projected</em> from the curved surface of the Earth onto a flat plane (e.g. a computer screen or a topographical map) to make it easier to compute distances between positions and calculate areas. There are many choices of projection (e.g. equirectangular, mercator, stereographic, orthographic etc.), each of which is designed for particular tasks. As with datums, projections are often chosen to better support regional, national or local needs.</p>
                <p>It is also worth noting that as a living planet, the Earth continues to change its shape; for example, continental drift moves Australia north-eastwards several centimeters each year and New Zealand shifts in multiple directions. To retain accuracy, datums need to be adjusted from time to time - as is the case of the the New Zealand Geodetic Datum (NZGD2000) that is frequently revised to take account of earth deformations.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Sometimes we don't want to measure relative to the surface of the Earth at all:</p>
                <p>Spatial data such as descriptions of the built environment, geological surveys or satellite imagery etc. are often captured and stored in an <em>engineering</em> coordinate refence system as measurements from a local datum (e.g. <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> pixel positions along orthogonal axes of an image or, in the case of linear referencing, distance along a specified feature from a fixed point).</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Although it is possible to convert coordinates from one CRS to another, many users will be put off by the need to do so. Furthermore, the need for such transformations introduces a point where errors can be introduced to the spatial data - especially where users have limited expertise with spatial data.</p>

            <p>When publishing spatial data it is best to help users avoid the need for them to transform spatial data between coordinate reference systems themselves by providing data in a form, or forms, which they can use directly. To determine which coordinate reference system(s) are needed, data publishers must consider the intended applictions of their user community.</p>

          </section>
          <section class="outcome">
            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>Spatial data is provided in a coordinate reference system, or systems, that are sensitive to the needs of user's intended applications.</p>
            <p>The majority of a publisher's anticipated user community do not need to transform coordinate values prior to using the spatial data.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>Whichever <a>coordinate reference system</a> is chosen for the publication of spatial data, it is imperative that that choice is made clear to users. Please refer to <a href="#bp-crs" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 17: State how coordinate values are encoded</a> for further details.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The first thing that publishers of spatial data need to do is consider their audience.</p>

            <p>When publishing spatial data on the Web, the largest community of potential users will be unknown: anyone might find and use data published on the Web! To support this <em>unanticipated reuse</em>, we recommend <em>always</em> publishing your spatial data using a global coordinate reference system which allows spatial data data from multiple sources to be readily combined for display or computation. WGS 84 Lat/Long (<a href="http://epsg.io/4326">EPSG:4326</a>) or WGS 84 Lat/Long/Elevation (<a href="http://epsg.io/4979">EPSG:4979</a>) are good choices as many of the tools and applications used by Web developers are set up to use data from GPS-enabled mobile devices that all use WGS 84. Although Web Mercator (<a href="http://epsg.io/3857">EPSG:3857</a>) has global coverage data publishers should be aware that its geodetic datum is spherical and not true to the shape of the earth, thereby introducing positional differences of upto 20 kilometers when compared with WGS 84.</p>

            <p>Where considerations of the known user community (or communities) call for different coordinate reference systems, we recommend publishing spatial data in multiple representations: one for each of the prioritised coordinate reference systems. Clearly, the number of representations provided needs to be determined with respect to the associated effort. However, remember that a decision not to publish data in a priority CRS will result in each member of your user community needing to do that task - or them not using your data.</p>
            <p>Common reasons for needing to publish in additional coordinate reference systems include:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>publication through government data portals that require use of a projected CRS defined by the national mapping agency - and similar legislative requirements;</p>
                <p class="example">The <a href="https://bag.basisregistraties.overheid.nl/">Basisregistraties Adressen en Gebouwen</a> (BAG), or <em>Basic Registers for Addresses and Buildings</em>, provided by <a href="https://www.kadaster.nl/">Kadaster</a>, publishes data in both OGC CRS84 (using the WGS 84 geodetic datum) and the Amersfoort / RD (<a href="http://epsg.io/28992">EPSG:28992</a>) coordinate reference systems.</p>
                <p class="example">The INSPIRE Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Commission requires that the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 ETRS89 (<a href="http://epsg.io/4258">EPSG:4258</a>) is used for the referencing of spatial data sets.</p>
              </li>
              <li>applications such as defence and precision agriculture that require coordinates to be accurate to tens of centimeters or less, thereby requiring the use of a CRS with an alternative geodetic datum that provides a superior fit for the local or regional geographic area - noting that every CRS and datum should define the geographic area within which it is intended to be used;</li>
              <li>the need to support applications that work in a local frame of reference using an engineering CRS - such as in a urban environment, inside a building complex or using chainage along a survey line;</li>
              <li>avoiding computationally intensive reprojection of raster data within end-user applications; and </li>
              <li>the need to retain the integrity of raster data by publishing in its original projection, thereby avoiding modification of pixel values due to the reprojection.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="note">
              <p>Discussion of coordinate system transformations is beyond the scope of this best practice document. However, we note that there are a number of open source software implementations are available to help users do such conversions. These include: the <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">Geospatial Data Abstraction Library</a> (GDAL), the <a href="http://proj.osgeo.org/">Cartographic Projections Library</a> (PROJ.4), its associated <a href="http://proj4js.org/">JavaScript implementation</a> (PROJ4.JS) and the <a href="http://sis.apache.org/">Apache Spatial Information System Library</a> (SIS).</p>

          <p class="practicedesc">Search engines should be able to crawl spatial data on the Web and index spatial things for direct discovery by users.</p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>

            <p>In <a>SDIs</a> information about spatial datasets is published as authoritative metadata records and collated in Web-based catalogues. This approach causes a number of problems:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>the catalogues are often designed to primarily support expert users - people may not even be aware of their existence;</li>
              <li>once you have discovered a dataset that meets your needs and identified where it is available from, a second step is required to access the data itself - often requiring the use of unfamiliar protocols or complex API requests; and</li>
              <li>the data itself is not indexed - discovery relies on the metadata records that are often sparsely populated or out of date.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Search engines are the common starting point for people looking for content on the Web that is widely understood. By publishing spatial data in a way that enables their crawlers to index spatial datasets including each <a>spatial thing</a>, the fidelity of search results should improve. Users will be able to directly search for specific entities rather than having to look for a dataset and then parse through it; e.g. to search for "Anne Frank’s House" (<a href="https://g.co/kg/m/02s5hd"><code>https://g.co/kg/m/02s5hd</code></a>) rather than looking for a dataset about "Cultural Heritage in Amsterdam" and hoping that it contains a reference to what you’re interested in.</p>

            <p class="note">At present, spatial information is not widely exploited by search engines. However, by increasing the volume of spatial information presented to search engines, and the consistency with which it is provided, we expect search engines to begin offering spatial search functions. We already see evidence of this in the form of contextual search, such as prioritization of search results from nearby entities. In addition, search engines are beginning to offer more structured, custom searches that return only results that include certain [[SCHEMA-ORG]] types, like <a href="http://schema.org/Dataset">Dataset</a>, <a href="http://schema.org/Place">Place</a> or <a href="http://schema.org/City">City</a>.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="outcome">
            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>Information about spatial datasets and things is indexed by search engines.</p>

            <p>Users can find spatial things using common search engines.</p>
          </section>  
          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>

            <p>In general, you need to:</p>
            <ol>
            	<li>publish a HTML Web-page for the spatial dataset and each spatial thing that it describes; and</li>
            	<li>make sure that those pages can be crawled.</li>
            </ol>
            
				<p>The Web-page for the dataset is an entry-point for humans to browse and for the search engines to crawl your data. This landing page should provide descriptive metadata that helps users evaluate whether the dataset meets their needs (see <a href="#spatial-info-dataset-metadata">Best Practice 1: Include spatial metadata in dataset metadata</a> and [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#DescriptiveMetadata">Best Practice 2: Provide descriptive metadata</a>), and may provide links to other service end-points, APIs or tools that will help a user work with the dataset. The landing page should be indexable by the search engines so that it can be discovered too!</p>

        <p>To enable humans and Web-crawlers to find HTML pages for the spatial things, the "landing page" needs to include hyperlinks that can be followed. Where you have a larger collection of spatial things, you should support paging through the collection.</p> 

				<p>You may also consider using <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/index.html">Sitemaps</a> to direct the Web-crawler; noting that sitemaps currently are limited to several thousands of entries and will not work for larger datasets.</p>

				<p>For very large datasets paging through thousands of pages is not useful for a human either. Consider supporting filtering and/or organise the spatial things into subsets, as described in <a href="#ids-for-chunks">Best Practice 13: Provide subsets for large spatial datasets</a>.</p>

            <aside class="example">
            	<p>In case of an address dataset, you could organise the spatial things (the addresses) by municipality, post code and street name in order to support a human user to get to a building with a few clicks.</p>
            </aside>

				<p>A pre-condition for this best practice is <a href="#globally-unique-ids">Best Practice 7: Use globally unique persistent HTTP URIs for spatial things</a> as persistent identifiers are essential to support reliable indexing and linking. Traditionally spatial datasets have not been maintained with stable identifiers for spatial things, but to share spatial data on the Web stable identifiers are a must. Sharing spatial data is more than "just" making the dataset available on the Web.</p>

            <p>Each Web-page can likely be generated programmatically from the data you hold about the spatial thing, either directly from the data or by using an API that makes the data available on the Web.</p>

            <aside class="example">
            	<p>Possible implementation approaches for addressing this best practice in the context of an existing SDI are discussed in more detail in <a href="#convenience-apis">Best Practice 11: Expose spatial data through 'convenience APIs'</a> for additional information. For example, by using a proxy tool like <a href="https://github.com/interactive-instruments/ldproxy">ldproxy</a> or by mapping the data in the SDI dynamically to crawlable resources on the web using the [[R2RML]] standard and Linked Data Publication tools. Both approaches generate crawlable data from features in your spatial datasets at query time and allow to enrich the data on the Web with additional information and links.</p>
            </aside>

				<p>It is important to keep in mind that the HTML representations should not mainly be designed for the search engines, but they should present the data in a clear and understandable way to human users. The page about the spatial thing should be useful to a user and encourage others to link to the page when they share other information about the spatial thing. This typically will also improve the ranking of these pages in search results.</p>

            <aside class="example">
              <p>The <a href="http://maps.nanaimo.ca/data/property/">Property Search in the City of Nanaimo, Canada</a> provides a landing page and one page per property. The landing page offers a search capability and the option to browse by street. This data is indexed; a search for, for example, "2100 AARON WAY, NANAIMO, BC" in a popular search engine returns the Nanaimo data for this spatial thing as one of the first results.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://environment.data.gov.uk/bwq/profiles/">Bathing Water Quality Explorer for England</a> provides a landing page and one page per site. Sites can be searched, selected from a list or in a map.</p>
              <p>In both cases, the pages of the spatial things are generated from the underlying data at request time.</p>
              <p>The property Web-pages in Nanaimo also use [[MICRODATA]] annotations using [[SCHEMA-ORG]], which is discussed below.</p>
            </aside>

				<p>In addition to exposing the spatial data as linked HTML Web-pages, indexing by web-engines can be further enhanced by incorporating a description of the spatial thing as structured markup (in particular [[MICRODATA]] or [[JSON-LD]] annotations using [[SCHEMA-ORG]]) as this enables the search engines to make more detailed assumptions about your resource. It is important to note that this is not only helpful to search engines, but also to other tools that want to understand more about the semantics of the resource, for example, its location.</p>
				
				<p>In [[SCHEMA-ORG]], a spatial dataset is a <a href="http://schema.org/Dataset">Dataset</a> and a spatial thing is in general a <a href="http://schema.org/Place">Place</a> or an <a href="http://schema.org/Event">Event</a>. For some types of spatial things, more specific sub-types exist, for example <a href="http://schema.org/City">City</a> or <a href="http://schema.org/Mountain">Mountain</a>. 
				
				<p>Location information about a spatial thing is typically provided using a geometry (<a href="http://schema.org/GeoCoordinates">GeoCoordinates</a> or <a href="http://schema.org/GeoShape">GeoShape</a>) or a <a href="http://schema.org/PostalAddress">PostalAddress</a>. [[SCHEMA-ORG]] coordinates are restricted to WGS 84 with longitude and latitude. Supported geometry types are points, line strings, polygons, boxes and circles.</p>
				
				<p>Through the use of [[SCHEMA-ORG]] annotations, search engines and others can connect location information with other information, e.g. about the nature of the spatial thing, opening hours, contact details, etc.</p>
				
				<p>The use of [[SCHEMA-ORG]] for spatial data is in its early days and has to be understood as an "emerging practice".</p>

        <aside class="example" id="ex-schemaorg-dataset-and-place">

The same annotation could also be provided using [[MICRODATA]], but we use [[JSON-LD]] here as this presents the structured data in a more human-readable way.</p>

				    <p>Typically multiple formats for a resource are supported using two mechanisms: HTTP content negotiation and by adding format-specific file extensions to the resource URI like ".json", ".xml" or ".ttl". Content negotiation is the standard mechanism of HTTP and the format-specific URIs enable the use of clickable links to the resource in a specific format.</p>
				
				    <p>Search engines may also index resource representations in other formats than HTML.</p>

        <h3>Spatial Data Quality</h3>
        <p>[[DWBP]] provides a best practice discussing how the quality of data on the web should be
          described (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#quality">section 8.5 Data Quality</a> for
          more details). This section is based on the Data Quality section from [[DWBP]] and adds a
          best practice specific for spatial data.</p>
        <p>In the Spatial Metadata section we provided a <a href="#bp-crs-choice" class="sectionRef">Best Practice</a> on how
          to deal with CRS in spatial data on the web. There is also a clear link between CRS and
          data quality, because the accuracy of spatial data depends for a large part on the CRS
          used. This can be seen as conformance of data with a "standard" - in this case, a (spatial
          or temporal) reference system. This is how you can describe spatial data quality using
          different vocabularies. We will provide an example in this section. </p>

          <p><span id="desc-accuracy" class="practicelab">Describe the positional accuracy of
              spatial data</span></p>
          <p class="practicedesc">Accuracy and precision of spatial data should be specified in
            machine-interpretable and human-readable form.</p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>The amount of detail that is provided in spatial data and the resolution of the data
              can vary. No measurement system is infinitely precise and in some cases the spatial
              data can be intentionally generalized (e.g. merging entities, reducing the details,
              and aggregation of the data) [[Veregin]].</p>
            <p class="note">It is important to understand the difference between precision and
              accuracy. Seven decimal places of a latitude degree corresponds to about one
              centimeter. Whatever the precision of the specified coordinates, the accuracy of
              positioning on the actual earth's surface using WGS84 will only approach about a meter
              horizontally and may have apparent errors of up to 100 meters vertically, because of
              assumptions about reference systems, tectonic plate movements and which definition of
              the earth's 'surface' is used.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>When known, the resolution and precision of spatial data should be specified in a way
              to allow consumers of the data to be aware of the resolution and level of details that
              are considered in the specifications.</p>

        <h3>Spatial Data Versioning</h3>
        <p><a>Spatial things</a> and their attributes can change over time. For example, a lake may grow or shrink due to changes in climate, water extraction or any number of reasons. For many applications, it is important that information about spatial things is kept up to date. When new information is available, the data publisher may make this available on the Web according to their update schedule and policies. [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#dataVersioning">section 8.6 Data Versioning</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#AccessUptoDate">Best Practice 21: Provide data up to date</a> provide directly applicable guidance.</p>

        <p>When dealing with change to a spatial thing, you should consider its lifecycle; in particular, how much change is acceptable before a spatial thing can no longer be considered as the same resource. Consider Eddystone Lighthouse for example: the “Eddystone Light”, a maritime navigation aid, has existed in (more or less) the same place on Eddystone Rocks since 1698. A single HTTP URI (such as <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eddystone_Lighthouse"><code>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eddystone_Lighthouse</code></a>) is used to identify “the lighthouse on Eddystone rocks” for all that period. The lighthouse's attributes (such as its focal height, visible range and light characteristic) have changed over that period, but we still consider it to be the same lighthouse. However, if our interest is historic buildings, we would identify the four different structures that have stood on that site as different spatial things, from Winstanley's Eddystone Lighthouse (the first incarnation) to Douglass' Eddystone Lighthouse (the 4th and current incarnation). Incremental change for these structures during the entire period from 1698 is not appropriate; one structure replaces another and so each structure should be assigned a unique identifier. In summary, different things are important to different people!</p>

        <p>Essentially, the decision to assign a new identifier in response to change depends on how <em>domain experts</em> think about the lifecycle of the spatial thing, which then manifests in a data modelling choice. [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#dataVocabularies">section 8.9 Data Vocabularies</a> and <a href="#bp-expressing-spatial" class="sectionRef"></a> provide further guidance on the topic of data modelling; determining which concepts and relationships should be used to describe your area of interest.</p>

        <p>Data publishers should not attempt to guess <em>all</em> the purposes for which someone might use or reference their data - ending up with a super-complex data model that tries to cover every possible use case. Instead, data publishers should try to help data consumers make informed decisions about the best way to use the data by providing good metadata. When it comes to spatial things, or <em>any</em> resource, that changes over time, it is important to provide metadata about the life cycle of those entities and the resources used to describe them. Given that information, data consumers can make considered choices about which resource they want to link to. [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#metadata">section 8.2 Metadata</a> provides useful guidance.</p>

        <p>All that said, if you consider that the change affects the fundamental nature of the spatial thing, then you should assign a new identifier. See <a href="#bp-identifiers" class="sectionRef"></a> for more details. Otherwise, read on for guidance on how to describe properties that change over time.</p>

            <p><a>Spatial things</a> and their attributes change over time. Mostly, users are interested in current information. They need to be able to determine whether the published description of a spatial thing meets their needs. For example, is the published geographic extent of the City of Amsterdam relevant for a land-usage study of the nineteenth century? (<a href="http://www.gemeentegeschiedenis.nl">Gemeentegeschiedenis.nl</a>, "Parish History", illustrates how the extent of Amsterdam has changed during the past 200-years, in <a href="http://www.gemeentegeschiedenis.nl/gemeentenaam/Amsterdam">HTML</a> and <a href="http://www.gemeentegeschiedenis.nl/gemeentenaam/json/Amsterdam">GeoJSON</a>). Where the information is available, a user may want to browse older versions of the published information to understand the nature of any changes or to find historical information.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>Users are provided with the most recent version of information about a spatial things and its attributes by default.</p>
            <p>Users are able to determine the time period for which data is applicable.</p>
            <p>If a version history of changes is available, users are able to browse through a set of changes to see how a spatial thing and its attributes have changed over time.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>

            <p>When publishing information about a spatial thing that is subject to change there are three main approaches to consider:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>simply updating the description of the spatial thing in response to a change;</li>
              <li>providing a series of immutable snapshots that describe the spatial thing at various points in its lifecycle; and</li>
              <li>capturing a time-series of data values within an attribute of the spatial thing.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Whichever approach is chosen, publishers of spatial data should consider how dataset metadata plays an important part in helping users determine whether a dataset is fit for their use. Particularly where the contents of a dataset change with time, statements about the (most recent) publication date, the frequency of update and the time period for which the dataset is relevant (i.e. temporal extent) should be provided. Please refer to [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#DescriptiveMetadata">section 8.2 Metadata</a> for more details about dataset metadata.</p> 

            <p>A description of the lifecycle of the spatial things (e.g. what triggers a change and whether those changes are versioned etc.) should also be provided in either the dataset's metadata, schema or specification. For example, the UK's Digital National Framework policy states that data publishers must provide these lifecycle rules.</p>

            <p>Approach (1) is lightweight and should only be used where there are no user requirements that require access to older descriptions of the spatial things. Data publishers simply replace the old description of the spatial thing with the amended description and keep users informed about updates by providing the appropriate metadata (e.g. when the data was changed). This may be achieved using dataset metadata (as outlined above) or by including the metadata attributes in the description of each spatial thing.</p>

            <p>Where users are anticipated to need to understand <em>how</em> a spatial thing has changed over time, approaches (2) and (3) must be considered.</p>

            <p>Approach (2) requires the data publisher to publish immutable resources that describe the spatial thing at specific points in time (i.e. "snapshots") and provide a mechanism for users to browse between those snapshots. Given that each snapshot of the spatial thing is published as a separate resource, this approach is suited to infrequent changes so that the number of snapshots does not become unweildy.</p>

            <p>The URI for the spatial thing, the <em>base</em> URI, should resolve to provide the current information and a link to its version history of snapshots. [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#VersionHistory">Best Practice 8: Provide version history</a> describes how a version history may be implemented. Each snapshot resource within the version history must be uniquely identified; a common approach is to append a date/time stamp to the base URI as a version indicator. [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#VersioningInfo">Best Practice 7: Provide a version indicator</a> provides relevant guidance.</p>

            <p>Approach (3) is suitable where a spatial thing has a small number of attributes that are frequently updated. For example, the GPS-position of a runner or when streaming data from a sensor, such as the water level from a stream guage.</p>

            <p>With this approach, the description of the spatial thing must include a property that contains a sequentially-ordered set of data-points, each of which defines a time-stamp and the values for the time-varying attribute(s). By definition, this property can be considered as a time-series <a>coverage</a>. Standard data encodings are available for time-series data, including: [[TIMESERIESML]] for GML, plus [[COVERAGE-JSON]] and [[SENSORTHINGS]] for JSON.</p>

            <p class="note">The OGC [[MOVING-FEATURES-XML]] and [[MOVING-FEATURES-CSV]] specifications follow the pattern described above. A <code>trajectory</code> element is used to describe the position of a spatial thing, and varying attributes (such as orientation or rotation) can be added alongside the tuples in the trajectory. However, there is limited evidence of adoption outside of Japan.</p>

        <h3>Spatial Data Identifiers</h3>
        <p>The primary topics of any spatial dataset are <a>spatial things</a>, each described by a set of attributes and usually at least one geometry. How your spatial data is structured will depend on the vocabulary or data model you use (see <a href="#bp-expressing-spatial" class="sectionRef"></a> for further details on vocabulary choice). This will determine the types of entities that, along with the spatial things themselves, are important enough to be given identifiers so that statements can be made about them. Geometry objects are an example of an entity that is often assigned a unique identifier so that they can be referenced or reused.</p>

        <p>To publish spatial data on the Web, we need to stitch the spatial things and their corresponding entities into the Web’s information space; contributing to the <em>Web of data</em>. First: [[WEBARCH]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#p38">Good Practice: Identify with URIs</a> states that "agents should provide URIs as identifiers for resources". Second: the <a href="http://5stardata.info">5 Star Data scheme</a> states: "&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; use URIs to denote things, so that people can point at your stuff".</p>

        <p>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#identifiersWithinDatasets">Best Practice 10: Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets</a> provides directly applicable guidance. When identifying resources, it advises:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Seek and reuse existing URIs, ensuring that the URIs are persistent and they are published by a trusted group or organization; or</li>
          <li>Create your own persistent URIs.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Furthermore, given ubiquitous use of the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) on the Web, we SHOULD use HTTP URIs to identify resources in spatial data.</p>

        <p class="note">We consider identifiers in the Web’s information space to be unaffected by the choice to serve HTTP content securely or not. For example, <code>http://example.org/country/suriname</code> and <code>https://example.org/country/suriname</code> both identify the same spatial thing - in this case the South American country of Suriname.</p>

        <p>Resources identified with HTTP URIs can be specified as the target of links within the Web’s global information space, enabling information from different sources to be related and combined. This is the fundamental basis of 5&#9733; Linked Data: "&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; link your data to other data to provide context".</p>

        <div class="practice">
          <p><span id="globally-unique-ids" class="practicelab">Use globally unique persistent HTTP URIs for spatial things</span></p>
          <p class="practicedesc">Use stable HTTP URIs to identify spatial things, re-using commonly used URIs where they exist and it is appropriate to do so.</p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>The Web works with resources that are identified using HTTP URIs. We want <a>Spatial things</a> to be first class resources on the Web that we want to make statements about and relate to other resources. To do this, spatial things need to be addressable resources in the Web’s global information space which means they must be identified using HTTP URIs.</p>
            
            <p>This is a fundamentally different data publication approach to what is typical today where the dataset is (often) globally identified, but individual spatial things, or "<a>features</a>" in SDI parlance, are not - at least not with a persistent identifier.</p>

            <p>The HTTP URIs used to identify spatial things need to be stable or persistent so that relationships that link them to other resources don’t break.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="outcome">
            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>Spatial things become part of the Web’s global information space enabling them be linked with other spatial things and other resources and for those links to be durable. In other words, spatial data becomes part of the Web of Data.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>The Web of data is made up of <em>subjects</em> and <em>objects</em>; the things we talk about and the things we refer to. For example, we could say that <strong>Anne Frank's House</strong> (the <em>subject</em>) is within <strong>the Municipality of Amsterdam</strong> (the <em>object</em>). In RDF this looks like:</p>

            <p><code>&lt;</code><a href="https://g.co/kg/m/02s5hd"><code>https://g.co/kg/m/02s5hd</code></a><code>&gt;</code> <a href="http://schema.org/containedInPlace"><code>schema:containedInPlace</code></a> <code>&lt;</code><a href="http://sws.geonames.org/2759793"><code>http://sws.geonames.org/2759793</code></a><code>&gt;</code> <code>.</code></p>

            <p>When considering HTTP URIs for <em>objects</em> (e.g. the target of our hyperlinks) it makes sense to reuse existing identifiers. After all, you <em>are</em> trying to stitch your spatial data into the Web so that we can "link your data to other data" and achieve a &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; rating! Organizations such as <a href="http://dbpedia.org">DBPedia</a>, <a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a> and government mapping and cadastral authorities (that publish national registers of addresses, buildings, etc.) are good sources of stable, authoritative URIs. Appendix <a href="#auth-id-sources" class="sectionRef">B. Authoritative sources of geographic identifiers</a> lists sources of URIs for spatial things, and the steps described for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ld-bp/#how-to-find-existing-vocabularies">discovering existing vocabularies</a> [[LD-BP]] can be readily adapted to find more. For more details about how you might link to these authoritative identifiers, see <a href="#bp-linking" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>

            <p>However, HTTP URIs for <em>subjects</em> (e.g. the resource that we want to make statements about) can be a bit more tricky. If you are working purely with data then you can reuse existing URIs minted by other authorities for your <em>subject</em> URIs. But publishing spatial data on the Web means that the URIs for each spatial thing should resolve to Web pages or data resources that provide useful information (see <a href="#indexable-by-search-engines" class="sectionRef"></a>). An HTTP request will be directed to a host Web server, identified by the internet domain name (or IP address) in the requested URI. If you use a URI with an internet domain name where you have no control over how the Web server behaves, then there is no way for your statements to be included in the Web server's response.</p>

            <p>To take control of how information about spatial things is presented, data publishers need to assign their subject spatial things HTTP URIs from an internet domain name where they have authority over how the Web server responds. Typically, this means minting new HTTP URIs. It's all worth considering that the use of a particular internet domain may reinforce the authority of the information served. For example, a URI for Anne Frank's House is: <a href="https://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/monuments?MonumentId=4296"><code>https://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/monuments?MonumentId=4296</code></a>. The use of the internet domain registered to the <a href="http://cultureelerfgoed.nl/">Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands</a> gives the definition authenticity.</p>

            <div class="note">
              <p>The need to control what information is provided about a given spatial thing means that it is not uncommon for a spatial thing to be identified by multiple HTTP URIs. The equality between two URIs that refer to the same resource can be stated using a property such as <code>owl:sameAs</code>. Care must always be taken when using <code>owl:sameAs</code> to determine that the two URIs actually refer to the same resource, rather than two resources that are similar. Warning: don't say if you're not sure it's true!</p>
              <p>For more information about the types of properties that can be used to link between spatial things, and between spatial things and other resources, see <a href="#bp-linking" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>
            </div>

            <p>When minting your own URIs, [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#identifiersWithinDatasets">Best Practice 10: Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets</a> cites the advice from GS1's SmartSearch Implementation Guideline [[GS1]] which suggests that your URIs should include the type of resource that is being identified to help human readability. Also, given the need for the HTTP URIs for spatial things to be used throughout their lifetime (and perhaps beyond) you should give some thought to designing a URI that is persistent.</p> 
            <aside class="example" id="ex-amsterdam-station-uri">
              <p>This URI identifies the Amsterdam Central train station: </p>
              <p><code>https://brt.basisregistraties.overheid.nl/top10nl/id/gebouw/102625209</code></p>
              <p>This URI was minted using the recommendations in the Dutch URI strategy. Although minted by the Kadaster, they chose to use the domain ‘basisregistraties.overheid.nl’ (which translates to ‘base registries . government . nl’) because this is expected to be a more persistent name than ‘kadaster.nl’. Even though the Kadaster is over a 100 years old, organization names are not considered persistent in general as organizations may merge or their names may change. ‘top10nl’ is the name of the dataset, and ‘gebouw’ means ‘building’ – giving the human reader of this URI a clue of what is being identified. The last part of the URI is the building number from the dataset.</p>
            </aside>

            <p>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#UniqueIdentifiers">Best Practice 9: Use persistent URIs as identifiers of datasets</a> cites the European Commission's Study on Persistent URIs [[PURI]] as a good source from which to gain insights about designing persistent URIs.</p>

            <p>When an HTTP URI is resolved, the server will respond with a sequence of bytes: by its nature, HTTP can only serve <em>information resources</em> such as Web pages or JSON documents. Yet a spatial thing is actually a real or conceptual phenomenon - a lake is made from water not information! Using a single URI to refer to <em>both</em> the spatial thing and the page/document that describes the spatial thing introduces a URI collision. This can impose a cost in communication due to the effort required to resolve ambiguities. [[URLs-in-data]] has more to say on this subject, including recommending URI design patterns that enable differentiation between the spatial thing and the page/document that describes it.</p> 

            <p>However, in most cases using a single URI for both spatial thing and the page/document is simpler to implement and meets the expectations of most end-users. As stated in [[WEBARCH]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-webarch-20041215/#indirect-identification">section 2.2.3 Indirect Identification</a>, identifiers are commonly used in this way. There is no obligation to distinguish between the spatial thing and the page/document unless your application requires this.</p> 

            <div class="note">
              <p>While there is a cost to this conflation, problems can be mitigated by avoiding making statements that confuse spatial thing and the page/document, such as “Uluru is available in KML format”; e.g. <code>&lt;</code><a href="http://sws.geonames.org/7645281"><code>http://sws.geonames.org/7645281</code></a><code>&gt; dc:hasFormat ex:kml .</code></p>
              <p>This statement is clearly not true; an ancient monolith covering more than 3 km<sup>2</sup> cannot be provided in XML!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="issue" data-number="208">
              <p>There is a level of discomfort in the wider community (based on discussion with Platform Linked Data Nederland folks amongst others) about whether this best practice should recommend "indirect identifiers" (where spatial thing and page/document both share the same URI) while the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2005Jun/0039.html">TAG Guidance</a> (albeit from 2005) states that a <code>HTTP 303 (see other)</code> response should be provided by servers resolving the URI of a non-information resource (such as a spatial thing), referring the user agent to the corresponding information resource. (i.e. the <code>/id</code> and <code>/doc</code> pattern that is in widespread use but often seems to confuse users and even some experts).</p>

              <p>We pretty much agreed that use of indirect identifiers was OK during our <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/09/19-sdw-minutes.html#item04">discussion at TPAC-2016</a>. That said, we didn't record a resolution.</p>

              <p>If we want to stick with the TAC guidance, suggest that we remove the paragraph beginning</p>
              <blockquote>However, in most cases using a single URI for both spatial thing and the page/document [...]</blockquote>
              <p>and the following note, and replace with:</p>
              <blockquote>Dereferencing URIs for spatial things should result in a <code>HTTP 303 (see other)</code> response that redirects the user agent to the corresponding page/document. This means that the spatial thing and the page/resource MUST have different URIs. It is common to use <code>/id</code> as part of the URI for non-information resources, and <code>/doc</code> for the corresponding page/document.</blockquote>
              <p>That said, [[URLs-in-data]] provides other alternatives such as using a <code>#id</code> fragment.</p>
            </div>

            <p>HTTP URIs for spatial things should not include any indication of the data format used to encode the page/document as this may change as your systems evolve. That said, you may wish to provide a set of complementary resources that specify a particular format as part of your content negotiation strategy. For example, the URI <a href="http://sws.geonames.org/7645281/about.rdf"><code>http://sws.geonames.org/7645281/about.rdf</code></a> resolves to provide an RDF/XML encoding of the information about Uluru in the Northern Territory of Australia (<a href="http://sws.geonames.org/7645281"><code>http://sws.geonames.org/7645281</code></a>).</p>

            <p>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#identifiersWithinDatasets">Best Practice 10: Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets</a> notes that URIs can be long. You may need to define identifiers that are locally unique within your spatial dataset and provide a mechanism to programmatically convert each local identifier to a URI. For example, the Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data [[TABULAR-METADATA]] achieves this using URI Templates as described in [[RFC6570]].</p>

            <p>It is also good practice to use a redirection service to hide complex and potentially changing service end-point URLs, such as for a <a>Web Feature Service</a> behind well-designed URIs. This means that users don’t need to be aware of the complexities of the API or changes in endpoint URIs or API versions in order to request information about a particular spatial thing. For example, the URI <code>http://data.example.org/aan/id/perceel/aan.2528</code> could be used as proxy for the WFS GetFeature request <a href="http://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/aan/wfs?VERSION=2.0.0&SERVICE=WFS&REQUEST=GetFeature&featureID=aan.2528"><code>http://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/aan/wfs?VERSION=2.0.0&amp;SERVICE=WFS&amp;REQUEST=GetFeature&amp;featureID=aan.2528</code></a>.</p>

            <p>Finally, while it is simple to use a query-pattern URL to serve information about a resource identified with a URI from a third-party internet domain, e.g. <code>http://example.org/museums?q=http://sws.geonames.org/6618987</code>, these URLs are unsuitable as persistent identifiers. More often than not, your intended users will dereference the "official" URI, e.g. <code>http://sws.geonames.org/6618987</code>. That said, this kind of search operation does provide a useful mechanism to find particular spatial things. See <a href="#include-search-api" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 12: Include search capability in your data access API</a> for further details.</p>

        <h3>Spatial Data Vocabularies</h3>
        <p>In this document there is no section on formats for publishing spatial data on the web. The formats are basically the same as for publishing any other data on the web: XML, JSON, CSV, RDF, etc. Refer to [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#dataFormats">section 8.6 Data Formats</a> for more information and best practices. </p>
        <p>That being said, it is important to publish your spatial data with clear semantics, i.e. to provide information about the contents of your data. The primary use case
          for this is you have information about a collection of SpatialThings and you want to
          publish precise information about their attributes and how they are inter-related. Another
          use case is the publication on the Web of a dataset that has a spatial component in a form
          that search engines will understand. </p>
        <p>Depending on the format you use, the semantics may already be described in some form. For example, in GeoJSON [[RFC7946]] this description is present in the specification. When using JSON it is possible to add semantics using a JSON-LD @context. For providing semantics to search engines, using [[SCHEMA-ORG]] is a good option, as explained in <a href="#indexable-by-search-engines" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 4: Make your spatial data indexable by search engines</a>. </p>
        <p>In a linked data setting, the attributes of a spatial thing can be described using existing vocabularies, where
          each term has a published definition. [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#ReuseVocabularies">Best Practice 15: Reuse vocabularies, preferably standardized ones</a> recommends using terms from an established widely used vocabulary. If you can't find a suitable existing vocabulary term, you should create
          your own, and publish a clear definition for the new term (see [[LD-BP]]. We recommend that you link your own vocabulary to commonly used existing ones
          because this increases its usefulness. We provide the mapping between some commonly used spatial vocabularies. </p>
        <div class="issue" data-number="225">
          <p>We must avoid being overly focused on RDF.</p>
          <p>The [[LD-BP]] reference makes this section very RDF dependent. Is there a need /
            justification for this? Are we saying that RDF is the only recommended way to publish
            data and models on the Web? Web developers may not care about RDF vocabularies and maybe
            they prefer a Swagger document (just to pick an example)?</p>
          <p>To reduce the RDF focus, some text was added. </p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>The current list of RDF vocabularies / OWL ontologies for spatial data being considered

            including mapping between vocabularies, pointers about inconsistencies in vocabularies

          <p>The NOTE will be concerned with helping data publishers choose the right
            spatial data format or vocabulary. It provides a methodology for

        <p class="note">The motivation behind the <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/locn#">ISA Programme
            Location Core Vocabulary</a> was establishing a <em>minimal core common</em> to existing
          spatial vocabularies. However, experience suggests that such a <em>minimal common

          one's application needs.</p>

          <h4>Describing location</h4>
          <p>Location information is often a common thread running through such data and can be an important 'hook' for finding information and for integrating different datasets. There are different ways of describing the location of spatial things. You can use and/or refer to the name of a well known named place, provide the location's coordinates as a geometry or describe it in relation to another location. These last two options are described in this section.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>Steps to follow: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Decide on the geometric data representations based on performance; often the
                geometry data is a large proportion of the total size of a dataset.</li>
              <li>Determine the dimensionality of geometry data (0d 'point' to 3d 'volume').</li>
              <li>Determine in which coordinate reference system(s) (CRS) the data should be published (ref to section about CRS). Not all formats and vocabularies support the use of other CRS besides the most common one on the Web, WGS84.</li>
              <li>Determine which format(s) are supported by software tools that you anticipate
                your user community to employ; where multiple formats are in required, consider
                offering as many representations as you can - balancing the benefit of ease of use
                against the cost of the additional storage or additional processing if converting
                on-the-fly. See [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#Conneg">Best Practice 19: Use content negotiation for serving data available in multiple formats</a> for more
                information.</li>
              <li>Choose the right format and decide when to use geometry literals. For geometry
                literals, several solutions are available, like Well-Known Text (<a>WKT</a>)
                representations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash">GeoHash</a> and
                other geocoding representations. The alternative is to use structured geometry
                objects as is possible, for example, in [[GeoSPARQL]].</li>
              <li>There are also several suitable binary data formats (e.g. <a
                  href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">Google's protocol
                  buffers</a> for vector tiling); however, some binary formats do not
                (effectively) work on the Web as there are no software tools for working with
                those formats from within a typical Web application; to work with data in such
                formats, you must first download the data and then work with it locally. </li>
              <li>There are widespread practices for representing geometric data as linked data,
                such as using W3C [[W3C-BASIC-GEO]] (geo) <code>geo:lat</code> and <code>geo:long</code>
                that are used extensively for describing <code>geo:Point</code> objects.</li>
              <li>Concrete geometry types are available, such as those defined in the OpenGIS
                [[Simple-Features]] Specification, namely 0-dimensional Point and MultiPoint;
                1-dimensional curve LineString and MultiLineString; 2-dimensional surface Polygon
                and MultiPolygon; and the heterogeneous GeometryCollection. </li>

          <h4>Publishing data with clear semantics</h4>
          <p>In most cases, the effective use of information resources requires understanding thematic concepts in addition to the spatial ones; "spatial" is just a facet of the
            broader information space. For example, when the <a href="http://www.brandweer.nl/amsterdam-amstelland">Dutch Fire Service</a> responded to an incident at a day care center, they needed to evacuate the children. In this case, the <em>2nd</em> closest alternative day care center was preferred because it was operated by the same organization as the one that was subject of the incident, and they knew who all the children were.</p>

          <p>This best practice document provides mechanisms for determining how places and locations are related - but determining the compatibility or validity of thematic data elements is beyond our scope; we're not attempting to solve the problem of different views on the same/similar resources.</p>

          <p>That said, there is one aspect of thematic semantics that must be mentioned. The most important semantic statement you can make when publishing spatial data - or any data - is to specify the <em>type</em> of a resource. For spatial things, there are a number of types that define "spatialness" (see <a href="#bp-expr-geo" class="sectionRef"></a>). But you should also consider non-spatial aspects when designating the type of a spatial thing. For example, should a fire incident occur at Amsterdam Central railway station, it might seem sensible for the Municipal Fire Department to designate a type such as <strong>Building</strong> or <strong>Station</strong> (the Dutch Government Base Registry defines Amsterdam Central railway station, identified as <a href="https://brt.basisregistraties.overheid.nl/top10nl/id/gebouw/102625209"><code>https://brt.basisregistraties.overheid.nl/top10nl/id/gebouw/102625209</code></a>, designates both of these types). However, the Fire Department are concerned with a <em>fire incident</em> - not the railway station itself. The fire incident is a spatial thing (it has spatial extent) but it is <em>not</em> the station. For example, the fire may spread to adjacent buildings. The Fire Department might designate their spatial thing as having type <strong>FireIncident</strong> or similar. Advice on how to assign a persistent identifier to the fire incident is provided in <a href="#globally-unique-ids" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 7: Use globally unique persistent HTTP URIs for spatial things</a>, and <a href="#bp-linking" class="sectionRef"></a> provides guidance on how one might relate the fire incident to other conincident spatial things such as Amsterdam Central railway station.</p>

              <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
              <p>There are various vocabularies that provide common information (semantics) about

                <p>This best practice provides a method for selecting the right vocabulary (or vocabularies)
                for your intended goal. The semantic description of entities and their properties
                should use the existing common vocabularies in their descriptions to increase the
                interoperability with other descriptions that may refer to the same vocabularies.
                The steps required to choose the best vocabularies are: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Go through a selection process to decide on the existing and relevant
                  vocabularies that can be used to describe the spatial things and their properties. </li>
                <li>Maintain links to the vocabularies in the schema definitions and provide
                  linked-data descriptions.</li>
                <li>Define location and spatial references using the common vocabulary concepts
                  whenever applicable instead of defining your own location instance. </li>
                <li>Provide thematic semantics and general descriptions of spatial things and their
                  properties as linked data. They should have URIs that return human and machine

        <h3>Spatial Data Access</h3>
        <p>In recent years we have seen widespread emergence of Web applications that use spatial data.
			 Often these applications do not access all the spatial data they use via the Web. While there 
			 are good reasons for this, e.g. licensing restrictions, it is often the case, too, that the
			 spatial data is not available via the Web at all, or in ways that application developers find
			 too complex to use, or with insufficient or unclear quality-of-service commitments.</p>
        <p>[[DWBP]] provides best practices discussing access to data using Web infrastructure (see [[DWBP]] <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#dataAccess">section 8.10 Data Access</a>). This
          section provides additional insight for publishers of spatial data. </p>
        <p>Making data available on the Web requires data publishers to provide some form of
          access to the data. There are numerous mechanisms available, each providing varying
          levels of utility and incurring differing levels of effort and cost to implement and
          maintain. Publishers of spatial data should make their data available on the Web using
          affordable mechanisms in order to ensure long-term, sustainable access to their
          data.</p>
        <p>When determining the mechanism to be used provide Web access to data, publishers need
          to assess utility against cost. In order of increasing usefulness and cost:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Bulk-download or streaming of the entire or pre-defined subsets of a dataset</li>
          <li>Generalized spatial data access API</li>
          <li>Bespoke API designed to support a particular type of use</li>
        </ol>
		  <p>Let's take a closer look at these options.</p>
        <p>The download of a dataset - or a pre-defined subset of it - via a single HTTP 
			 request is mainly covered by these [[DWBP]] best practices:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#BulkAccess">Best Practice 17: Provide bulk
            download</a>,</li>
          <li>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#ProvideSubsets">Best Practice 18: Provide 
            Subsets for Large Datasets</a>, and</li>
          <li>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#Conneg">Best Practice 19: Use content 
            negotiation for serving data available in multiple formats</a>.</li>
        </ul>
		  <p>Providing bulk-download or streaming access to data is useful in any case and
		    is relatively inexpensive to support as it relies on standard capabilities of web servers 
		    for datasets that may be published as downloadable files stored on a server.
		    However, this option is more complex for frequently changing datasets or real-time data.</p>
		  <p>The use of APIs to access data is covered in [[DWBP]] by the following best practices:</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#useanAPI">Best Practice 23: Make data 
		      available through an API</a>,</li>
		    <li>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#APIHttpVerbs">Best Practice 24: Use Web 
		      Standards as the foundation of APIs</a>,</li>
		    <li>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#documentYourAPI">Best Practice 25: Provide 
		      complete documentation for your API</a>, and</li>
		    <li>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#avoidBreakingChangesAPI">Best Practice 26: 
		      Avoid Breaking Changes to Your API</a></li>
		  </ul>
        <p>For spatial data, <a>SDIs</a> have long been used to provide generalized access to 
          spatial data via web services, typically using open standard specifications from the 
          <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> (OGC). 
          The main examples are <a>Web Feature Service</a>, <a>Web Coverage Service</a>, <a>Sensor 
          Observation Service</a>, <a>SensorThings</a> or [[GeoSPARQL]] for access to data, or <a>Web Map Service</a> 
          and <a>Web Map Tile Service</a> for access to data rendered as map. With the exception 
          of the <a>Web Map Service</a>, the OGC standards have not seen widespread adoption 
          beyond the geospatial expert community.</p>
        <p>In addition, commercial offerings for publishing spatial data on the Web often provide
          access via product-specific APIs, too. These APIs are typically not restricted to 
          HTTP-based web service APIs in the sense of [[DWBP]] <a 
            href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#APIHttpVerbs">Best Practice 24: Use Web Standards 
          as the foundation of APIs</a>, but include APIs targeted at a specific programming 
          language, for example, JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In the list of options above, a third option is included as sharing spatial data
          on the Web using the first two options (bulk download or generalized APIs) may not
          be sufficient for reaching application developers. Reasons for this include:</p>  
        <ul>  
          <li>Generalized spatial data access APIs, like the OGC standards, typically and 
            intentionally cover a wide range of usages, including requirements of users that 
            are geospatial experts, and they support a broad range of spatial things. While 
            they are documented comprehensively, they are often not easy to understand and 
            the "Time to First Successful Call" (see [[DWBP]] <a 
              href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#documentYourAPI">Best Practice 25: Provide 
            complete documentation for your API</a>) may be too high for application 
            developers. A typical convenience API is a simple API that implements complex requirements
            and hides the complexity, e.g. coordinate reference system handling, from the 
            application developer.</li>
          <li>Spatial data as it is used by expert users may be complex. As users 
            need to understand how the data is structured in order to work effectively with 
            that data, this burdens the data user with significant effort before they 
            can even perform simple queries on data they have downloaded or access through 
            a generalized data access API.</li>
          <li>Spatial datasets tend to be large, often too large for direct use in Web 
            applications.</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>A useful 'bespoke API' mentioned in the third option provides convenience to 
        developers of the targeted applications, because the API designer has thought about 
        the needs of those developers when consuming the spatial data shared via the API.</p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>Providing access to spatial data via bulk download or generalized spatial 
              data access APIs may be too complex for application developers with 
              relatively simple requirements, if the spatial data or the API is complex 
              to understand or too large to handle in a Web application. 
              <strong>Convenience APIs</strong> are tailored to meet a specific goal;
              enabling a user to engage with complex data structures using (a set of)
              simple queries, including spatial search.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="outcome">
            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>The API provides a coherent set of queries and operations, including spatial 
              ones, that help users get working with the data quickly to achieve common tasks. 
              The API provides both machine readable data and human readable HTML markup.
              The human-readable markup will also support search engine's Web crawlers 
              to enable indexing of spatial data.</p>

            <p>The API should</p>
            <ul>
              <li>offer <em>both</em> machine readable data and human readable HTML that includes 
                the structured metadata required by search engines seeking to index content
                (see <a href="#indexable-by-search-engines" class="sectionRef">Best 
                Practice 4: Make your entity-level data indexable by search engines</a> 
                for details);</li>
              <li>follow the architectural guidance of the [[DWBP]] <a 
                href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#APIHttpVerbs">Best Practice 24: Use Web

              <li>be well documented and easy to understand, both in terms of the options 
                to access / filter the data and of the data structures that are returned
                (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#documentYourAPI">Best 
                Practice 25: Provide complete documentation for your API</a>);</li>
              <li>return data in chunks fit for use in Web applications and are useful sets
                of information. For large datasets this is related to [[DWBP]] <a 
                href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#ProvideSubsets">Best Practice 18: Provide 
                Subsets for Large Datasets</a>; this may be achieved, for example, by 
                filtering options that return appropriately sized subsets of the specific 
                dataset or by supporting paging (returning larger subsets in pages with
                forward/backward links). For paging, some patterns have been established,
                see for example <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-paging/">W3C Linked 
                Data Platform Paging</a> or <a 
                  href="https://www.w3.org/community/hydra/wiki/Pagination">Hydra
                pagination</a>. At the other end of the spectrum, overly small pieces of
                data are inconvenient to use, too. Data should be packaged in lumps that 
                are convenient to work with. An approach where very small, fine-grained 
                units of information are published that require further HTTP requests 
                to get the related information sufficient to determine context is not
                useful;</li>
              <li>support queries for <a>spatial things</a> based on user needs. For spatial data, 
                typical needs that should be considered are neighbourhood searches (e.g., 
                "what is near me?" or "what is near this spatial thing?") and searching for 
                things located in a specific area (e.g., an area shown as a map in an 
                application). Users will often look for a particular spatial thing without 
                knowning its identifier, too, in which case a fault-tolerant, free-text 
                search on the name, label or other property may be useful.</li>

            <p>In a <a href="http://docs.opengeospatial.org/wp/16-019r4/16-019r4.html">White 
              Paper about open geospatial APIs</a>, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has 
              defined the concept of the "OGC API Essentials" - a set of items defined
              in OGC standards and other open standards that are reusable modules 
              for use in geospatial APIs. The White Paper provides <a
                href="http://docs.opengeospatial.org/wp/16-019r4/16-019r4.html#_ogc_api_essentials_initial_list">an
              initial list</a> and many of the identified standards are mentioned in this 
              document. Reuse of standardized building blocks improves consistency and 
              interoperability across APIs. It is recommended to consider the OGC API 
              Essentials when defining an API to access spatial data.</p>

            <p>If the data is already published in a <a>Spatial Data Infrastructure</a>, 
              there are basically two options to publish the data via an additional
              convenience API.</p>
            <ol>   
              <li>
              <p>Reuse your existing spatial data infrastructure</p>
              <p>Use a RESTful API as a wrapper, proxy or a shim layer can be created 
                around SDI services. This aims at exposing 'generalized APIs' using 
                'convenience APIs' to make the data easier to use. 
                For example, in the geospatial domain there are a 
                lot of <a>WFS</a> services providing spatial data. Content from the WFS 
                service can be provided in this way as linked data, JSON or another
                Web friendly format using simple, navigable resources. 
                This approach is similar to the use of Z39.50 in 
                the library community; that protocol is still used but 'modern' Web sites 
                and Web services are wrapped around it.</p>
              <aside class="example">
                <p>An example of this approach of creating a convenience API that works 
                  dynamically on top of WFS is the experimental <a 
                  href="https://github.com/interactive-instruments/ldproxy">ldproxy</a>. 
                  This requires relatively little effort and is an attractive option for quickly 
                  exposing spatial data from existing WFS services on the Web. The approach is 
                  to create an intermediate layer by introducing a proxy on top of the 
                  WFS so the contained resources are made available. The proxy maps the 
                  data and metadata to schema.org according to a provided mapping scheme; 
                  assigns URIs to all resources based on a pattern; supports filtering 
                  based on a property; makes each resource available in HTML, XML, JSON-LD, 
                  GML, GeoJSON; and generates links to data in other datasets managed in triple 
                  stores using SPARQL queries. The API is documented and published using 
                  Swagger.</p>

              <aside class="example">
                <p>A similar approach, but for a specific dataset is the <a

                  API</a> in SwaggerHub, based on a WFS service published in the Dutch geoportal <a

              <p>A more effective route may be to provide an alternative 'Web friendly' 
                access path to the spatial data is to create a new, complementary service
                endpoint on top of the native storage of the dataset. This limits the 
                load on your SDI compared to the first option, which may matter as the 
                data access APIs of the SDI will continue to be used by expert users
                and their complex data management tasks.</p>

                  >ontop-spatial</a>) and Linked Data API. The data may be mapped dynamically 
                to resources on the Web using the [[R2RML]] standard and Linked Data 
                Publication tools. This process also allows to enrich the data represented
                in RDF with additional information and links. To maintain a direct link 
                between the spatial things provided through the SDI and as Linked Data, 
                use properties that link between the GML and RDF representations, for example,
                by including an additional feature property 'rdf_seealso' in the GML encoding 
                pointing to the RDF representation of the spatial thing.</p>

            <p>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#ProvideSubsets">Best Practice 18: Provide Subsets for Large Datasets</a> explains why providing subsets is important. Spatial datasets, particularly <a>coverages</a> such as satellite imagery, sensor

          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>Two possible approaches are described below:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Create named subsets. <ul>
                  <li>Determine how users may seek to access the dataset, determining subsets of the
                    larger dataset that are appropriate for the intended application. A data
                    provider may consider a general approach to improve accessibility of a dataset,
                    while a data user might want to publish details of a workflow for others to
                    reuse referencing only the relevant parts of the large dataset.</li>
                  <li>Given the anticipated access pattern, create new resources and mint a new
                    identifier for each subset.</li>
                  <li>Provide metadata to indicate how a given subset resource is related to the
                    original large dataset, with reference to an identified <em>Mutually Exclusive
                      Collectively Exhaustive</em> (MECE) set where appropriate.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Map a URI pattern to an existing data-access API. <p class="note">A Web service
                  URL in general does not provide a good URI for a resource as it is unlikely to be
                  persistent. A Web service URL is often technology and implementation dependent and
                  both are very likely to change with time. For example, consider oft used
                  parameters such as <code>?version=</code>. Good practice is to use URIs that will
                  resolve if the resource is relevant and may be referenced by others,
                  therefore identifiers for subsets should be <em>protocol independent</em>.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Identify the service end-point that provides access to the larger
                    dataset.</li>
                  <li>Determine which parameters offered by the service end-point are required to
                    construct a meaningful subset.</li>
                  <li>Map these parameters into a URI pattern and configure an HTTP server to apply
                    the necessary URL-rewrite.</li>

        <h3>Linking Spatial Data</h3>
        <p>Earlier in this document, the <a href="#linked-data" class="sectionRef">Linked Data</a> section explained that we  believe that Linked Data requires only that the formats used to publish data support Web linking. In other words, linking spatial data does not automatically mean the use of RDF; links can also be created, for example, using GML, HTML or JSON-LD.</p>
        <p>Links, in whatever machine-readable form, are important. In the wider Web, it is links that enable the discovery of web pages: from user-agents
          following a hyperlink to find related information to search engines using links to
          prioritize and refine search results. This section is concerned with the creation and use
          of those links to support discovery of the <a>SpatialThings</a> described in spatial
          datasets.</p>
        <p>For data to be <em>on the web</em> the resources it describes need to be connected, or
            <em>linked</em>, to other resources. The <em>connectedness</em> of data is one of the
          fundamentals of the Linked Data approach that these best practices build upon. The <a
            href="http://5stardata.info">5-star rating for Linked Open Data</a> asserts that to
          achieve the fifth star you must "link your data to other data to provide context". The
          benefits for consumers and publishers of linking to other data are <a
            href="http://5stardata.info/en/#addendum5">listed</a> as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can discover more (related) data while consuming the data.</li>
          <li>You can directly learn about the data schema.</li>
          <li>You make your data discoverable.</li>
          <li>You increase the value of your data.</li>
          <li>Your own organization will gain the same benefits from the links as the [other]
            consumers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Just like any type of data, spatial data benefits massively from linking when publishing
          on the web. The widespread use of links within data is regarded as one of the most
          significant departures from contemporary practices used within SDIs. That's why this topic is included in this Best Practice.</p>
       <p>Crucially, the use of links is predicated on the ability to identify the origin and
          target, or <em>beginning</em> and <em>end</em>, of the link. <a
            href="#globally-unique-ids">Best Practice 6: Use globally unique persistent HTTP URIs for spatial things</a> is a prerequisite.</p>
        <p>This section extends [[DWBP]] by providing a best practice about
            <em>creating</em> links between the resources described inside datasets.</p>
        <div class="note">
          <p>[[DWBP]] identifies <em>Linkability</em> as one of the <a
              href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#BP_Benefits">benefits</a> gained from implementing
            the Data on the Web best practices (see [[DWBP]] <a
              href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#DataIdentifiers">section 8.7 Data Identifiers</a>
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#UniqueIdentifiers">Best Practice 9: Use persistent URIs as identifiers of datasets</a> and <a
              href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#identifiersWithinDatasets">Best Practice 10: Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets</a>). However, no discussion is
            provided about how to create the links that the use those persistent URIs.</p>

        <div class="practice">
          <p><span id="entity-level-links" class="practicelab">Publish links from spatial things to related resources</span></p>
          <p class="practicedesc">The data should be published with explicit links, including spatial links, to spatial things or other
            resources,  both in the same dataset and in other datasets. </p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>Exposing entity-level links to Web applications, user-agents and Web crawlers allows the relationships between resources to be found without the data user needing to download the entire dataset for local analysis. Entity-level links, preferably meaningful links, provide explicit description of the relationships between resources and enable users to find related data and determine whether the related data is worth accessing. Entity-level links can be used to combine information from different sources; for example, to determine correlations in statistical data relating to the same location. </p>

            <p>Data publishers should assert the relationships that they know about. Relationships between resources with spatial extent (i.e. size, shape, or position; SpatialThings) can often be inferred from their spatial properties, but this is a complex task. It requires both complex spatial processing (e.g. region connection calculus)  and some degree of understanding about the semantics of the two, potentially related, resources in order to determine how they are related, if at all. This should not be left to the data user.</p>
            
            <p>When your spatial resources are linked to those in common usage it will be easier to discover them. For example, a data user interested in air quality data about the place they live might begin by searching for that place in popular data repositories such as <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">GeoNames</a>, <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a> or <a href="http://dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>. Once the user finds the resource that describes the correct place, they can search for data that refers to the identified resource that, in this case, relates to air quality. Furthermore, by referring to resources in common usage, it becomes even easier to find those resources as search engines will prioritize resources that are linked to more often.</p>

            <div class="note">
              <p>It is not always feasible to link your spatial things to other resources in common usage. For example, if you were maintaining a registry of cultural heritage in Amsterdam, it would be reasonably simple to look up identifiers for the city's 50 or so museums and map these to your spatial things. But it would be a huge task for, say, a topographic mapping agency to cross-reference their entire catalogue of named places containing tens of thousands of spatial things with third-party resources (although in the spirit of crowd-sourcing, if someone else found those links useful, they may take on the task of relating the spatial things and publishing those relationships to the Web as a complementary resource!).</p>
              <p>In essence, you should only manage the data that you have the resources to maintain.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>It should be possible for humans and for machine agents to understand, interpret and follow the entity-level links between resources. Preferably, the definition of the meaning of a given link is precise and explicit.</p>

            <p>Steps:</p>
            <p>1. Choose one of the following general methods to provide explicit entity-level links:</p>

              <li>Publish the data with links (to uniquely identified objects) embedded in the
                data.</li>
              <li>Publish sets of links as a complementary resource.</li>
              <li>Publish summaries of links for the dataset so that the semantics of the links can
                be evaluated and accessed if deemed appropriate.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="issue" data-number="36">The use of Linksets needs further discussion as
              evidence indicates that it is not yet a widely adopted best practice. It may be

                href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> anticipated
              broad adoption of XLink over time - and, with that adoption, provision of support
              within software tooling. While XML Schema, XPath, XSLT and XQuery etc. have seen good
              software support over the years, this never happened with XLink. The authors of GML
              note that given the lack of widespread support, use of Xlink within GML provided no
              significant advantage over and above use a bespoke mechanism tailored to the needs of
              GML.</p>

            <p>2. Make spatial relationships explicit</p>

            <p>It is a good idea to express spatial relationships between things explicitly in your data. A possible approach for this is to find out if they have corresponding geometries using spatial functions, and then express these correspondences as explicit relationships. If the spatial datasets you want to reconcile are managed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) or a spatial database, you can use the GIS spatial functions to find related spatial things. If your spatial things are expressed as Linked Data, you can use [GeoSPARQL], which has a set of spatial query functions available.</p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>The mechanics of how to decide when two resources are related, if they don't have geometric or topological properties that allow you to determine this, are beyond the scope of this best practice. Tools (e.g. <a href="http://openrefine.org">OpenRefine</a>
                and <a href="http://silk-framework.com">Silk Linked Data Integration Framework</a>)
                are available to assist with reconciliation based on e.g. geographical names or addresses present in the data and may provide further insight.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="note">
              <p>Where possible, existing identifiers should be reused when referring to resources (see <a href="#globally-unique-ids">Best Practice 7: Use globally unique persistent HTTP URIs for spatial things</a>). However, the use of multiple identifiers for the same resource is commonplace, for example, where data publishers from different jurisdictions refer to the same <a>SpatialThing</a>. In this special case, properties such as <code>owl:sameAs</code> can be used to declare that multiple identifiers refer to the same resource. It is often the case that data published from different sources about the same physical or conceptual resource may provide different view points. Note that you shouldn't use <code>owl:sameAs</code> to indicate that two spatial things are only similar, while not exactly the same.</p>

            </div>
            <p>3. Decide which spatial relationships to use</p>
            <p>To let user agents know what is at the end of a link, it's a good idea to use explicitly defined relationship types to link between resources. [[DWBP]] <a
              href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#dataVocabularies">section 8.9 Data
              Vocabularies</a> provides information on general relationship types described in well-defined vocabularies (see [[DWBP]] <a
                href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#ReuseVocabularies">Best Practice 15: Reuse vocabularies, preferably standardized ones</a>). </p>
            <p>Describing the spatial relationships between SpatialThings can be based on
              relationships such as topological (e.g. contains), geographical (e.g. nearby) and hierarchical (e.g. part of) links.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A good place to find spatial relationships to use is in spatial vocabularies. See <a href="#semantic-thing" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 9: Use spatial semantics for Spatial Things</a>.</li>
              <li>The geographical, topological and social hierarchy should be described with clear semantics using relations registered with IANA <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml">Link relations</a>.</li>
              <li>Hierarchical relationships (i.e. part of, for example between administrative regions, have a specific need for defining <em>Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive</em> (MECE) set.</li>
              <li>Topological relationships that are described for an entity should have references to concepts such as over, under etc.</li>
              <li>Spatial relationships can use concepts such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_connection_calculus">Region Connection Calculus</a> (RCC8) that contains, overlaps, touches, intersects, adjacent to, or "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM#Spatial_predicates">spatial predicates</a>" or also other similar concepts from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%27s_interval_algebra">Allen Calculus</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Social relationships can be defined based on perception; e.g. "samePlaceAs", nearby, south of. These relationships can also be defined based on temporal concepts such as: after, around, etc. In current practice, there is no such property as <code>samePlaceAs</code> to express the social notion of <em>place</em>; enabling communities to unambiguously indicate that they are referring to the same place but without getting hung up on the semantic complexities inherent in the use of <code>owl:sameAs</code> or similar.</p>
            <p class="issue" data-number="215">Include details of which spatial relationships are published as IANA Link relations.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>4. Determine the things to link to</p>
            <p>The links should connect spatial things rather than information resource(s) that describe them. In many cases, different identifiers are used to describe the <a>SpatialThing</a> and the information resource that describes that <a>SpatialThing</a>. For example, within <a href="http://dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>, the city of Sapporo, Japan, is identified as <code>http://dbpedia.org/<u>resource</u>/Sapporo</code>, while the information resource that describes this resource is identified as <code>http://dbpedia.org/<u>page</u>/Sapporo</code>. Care should be taken to select the identifier for the <a>SpatialThing</a> rather than the information resource that describes it; in the example above, this is <code>http://dbpedia.org/<u>resource</u>/Sapporo</code>.</p>
            <p>Besides making the links to things within the same dataset explicit, data publishers should also relate their data to commonly used spatial resources such as GeoNames using links. </p>
            <p>A list of sources of commonly used spatial resources is provided in
              <a href="#auth-id-sources" class="sectionRef"></a>. </p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>This best practice is concerned with the connections <em>between</em>
                <a>SpatialThings</a>. When describing an individual <a>SpatialThing</a> itself, it is often desirable to decompose the information into several uniquely identified objects. For example, the geometry of an administrative area may be managed as a separate resource due to the large number of geometric points required to describe the boundary.</p>
              <p></p>

        <h3>Dealing with large datasets</h3>
        <p>When publishing large datasets on the web, and designing APIs for accessing those datasets, data publishers must be aware of the constraints of operating in
          a Web environment. Providing access to large spatial datasets, such as <a>coverages</a>, is a
          particular challenge. The API should provide mechanisms to request subsets of the
          dataset that are a convenient size for client applications to manage.</p>

            against a URI. In general,  this will allow to look up the properties and features of a

          <p>This requirement specifies that useful information should be returned when a resource
            is referenced. This can include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Expressing properties and features of interest for a <a>SpatialThing</a> using
              common semantic descriptions.</li>
            <li>Expressing names of places; provides multiple names for your <a>SpatialThings</a> if
              they are known. These could be toponyms (names that appear on a map) or colloquial
              names (that local people use for a place). This part will explain in more detail how
              to provide the names/labels for the spatial things that are referred to. (e.g. a way
              to do this could be <code>rdfs:label</code>)</li>
            <li>A 'place' may have an indistinct (or even undefined) boundary. It is often useful to
              identify spatial things even though they are fuzzy. For example: 'Renaissance Italy'
              or 'the American West'.</li>
            <li>Information (about a <a>SpatialThing</a>; a place) should be provided with
              information about authority (owner, publisher), timeliness (i.e. is it valid now? is
              it historical data?) and, (if applicable) quality. It is common, for example, that
              there exist many maps of a place - none of them the same. In that case users need to

        <section class="axioms">
          <p class="subhead">Why</p>
          <p>The geometry of <a>spatial things</a> is described using coordinates; for example, <a>latitude</a> and <a>longitude</a>. Because coordinates describe a position relative to a datum (e.g. zero latitude is the equator and zero longitude is the prime meridian - often the Greenwich Meridian), it is important to understand both the datum and the units that are used for coordinates along with the order which the coordinate axes are defined: the <a>coordinate reference system</a> (CRS). Spatial data is published in a wide variety of CRS. This variety can create confusion and inconsistencies in using and interpreting spatial data. Unless the CRS is known, errors are likely to be introduced when determining the position of a spatial thing on the Earth and makes comparing or combining spatial data from different sources extremely problematic.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="outcome">
          <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
          <p>Sufficient information is provided to enable coordinates to be related to the correct position, thereby enabling spatial data to be correctly interpretted by humans and software agents.</p>
          <p>Spatial data from different sources can be combined without introducing unwarranted positional errors.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="how">
          <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
          <p>A user of spatial data will need to know:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>which coordinate value relates to which axis;</li>
            <li>what units used for each coordinate; and</li>
            <li>what datum is used</li>
          </ol>

          <div class="note">
            <p>There is a predominant view that "I just need to use Lat and Long - and I'm done".</p>
            <p>Although the vast majority of spatial data published on the Web uses WGS 84 Long/Lat (as used by GPS), we <em>strongly</em> recommend that spatial data is published with all the necessary information to interpret coordinate values. Even where it the use of latitude and longitude angular measurements is obvious, the choice of datum and units of measurement have an impact. In particular, angular measurements appearing as floating point numbers are mostly likely to be provided in decimal degrees, may be radians or gons (also known as grads).</p>
            <p>The problem that the assumption of a "predominant view" leads to ambiguity. For example, many spatial data users work entirely with information provided in their national coordinate reference system (such as the <em>Dutch Amersfoort / RD</em> <a href="http://epsg.io/28992">EPSG:28992</a> or <em>OSGB 1936 / British National Grid</em> <a href="http://epsg.io/27700">EPSG:27700</a>) which make all coordinates in WGS 84 Long/Lat (especially the negative numbers) utterly perplexing.</p>
            <p>In practice, a publisher not documenting their CRS and presuming that latitude and longitude can be treated as cartesian is often bailed out by fuzzy use cases and software that takes care of projections. However, CRS and coordinate axis order ambiguity leads sooner or later to serious and avoidable errors, while ignorance of datums and map projections leads to broken applications. Furthermore, these practices will also become less and less tenable as new applications such as Augmented Reality require higher data precision and accuracy.</p>
          </div>

          <p>There are four common ways that this information can be provided:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Provide each coordinate value with explicit labels and provide metadata to indicate what each label means.</p>

              <p>The labels (or terms) <code>w3cgeo:lat</code> and <code>w3cgeo:long</code> are provided by the [[W3C-BASIC-GEO]] vocabulary which states that it is:</p>

      <h2>Narrative - the Nieuwhaven flooding</h2>
      <p>This narrative introduces a flooding scenario as a background story for the Best
        Practice.</p>
      <p class="note">Names and places used in this scenario are fictional, procedures and practices
        may not reflect those used in the real world. Our intent is to provide a coherent context
        within which the best practices can be illustrated. We <strong>do not</strong> attempt to
        provide best practice for management of flooding events. However, many of the procedures
        discussed are based on information from <a

      <p>Nieuwhaven is a flourishing coastal city in the Netherlands. In common with much of the
        Netherlands, the low lying nature of Nieuwhaven make it prone to flooding from both rivers
        and the North Sea. To mitigate or reduce risks to homes and businesses, significant
        investment has been made to flood control and water management infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Flood Risk Management and Water Management are integrated in the Netherlands. By combining
        responsibilities for daily water management and flood risk management, the same people are
        involved who have a detailed knowledge of their water systems and flood defenses.</p>

      <p>Flood risk management can be separated into three layers: </p>
      <ol >
        <li>Flood alerts, evacuation, response and recovery (civil protection issues); both
          organizational and physical measures (e.g. identifying, checking, repairing and signaling
          evacuation routes).</li>
        <li>Spatial planning issues; reducing the impact of flooding through planning
          measures.</li>
        <li>Flood protection; constructing flood defenses to reduce the probability [of
          inundation and the impact of flooding]</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Our scenario concentrates on element (3).</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Describing predicted flood extent using vector geometries</h2>
        <p>The Nieuwhaven Water Board is the independent local government body responsible for regional water management; maintaining the system of dikes, drainage, canals and pumping stations that are designed to keep the city and surrounding environment from flooding. </p>
        <p>Based on assessment of historical flooding events, Newhaven Water Board is able to determine the extent of flooding that would occur as the result of hypothetical storm surge and river flooding events. </p>
        <div class="example">
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>tbd add example including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> inundation extent from hypothetical scenarios</li>
            <li>vector geometries for the inundation extent based on assessment against high-resolution DEM (Digital Elevation Model) / DTM (Digital Terrain Model) derived from photogrammetry &amp; lidar</li>
            <li>API enables users to define the geometry resolution (from 1m resolution up to 50m?) they need for their application using a query parameter [e.g. to manage the volume of complex geometries]</li>

      <section>
        <h2>Publishing statistical data for geographic areas</h2>
        <p>Municipal emergency services, public health authorities and water boards are grouped according to a “safety region” in order to establish a multi-disciplinary “emergency team” for crisis management. This helps to ensure that there is effective communication between those responsible for public safety and those responsible for flood control and water management.</p>
        <p>Each safety region prepares systematically for its own specific characteristics, based on available capabilities. This plan, the “Flood Response Plan”, includes evacuation strategies that are developed in response to hypothetical flooding events. Scenarios are prepared beforehand and carefully considered. The emergency team must be prepared at all times to deliver an assessment on a disaster / incident scenario and advise on proposed interventions, e.g. evacuation and deployment of temporary flood defenses.</p>
        <p>In developing the Flood Response Plan, the numbers of citizens impacted by each hypothetical flooding event are determined by cross-referencing the areas affected by surface water flooding with census data.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/about-us/organisation">Statistics Netherlands</a> (CBS) publishes reliable and coherent statistical information which respond to the needs of Dutch society and is responsible for compiling official national statistics.</p>
        <p>CBS makes use of OData, the Open Data Protocol v4, to provide open datasets for use by third parties. Furthermore, CBS provides a search interface to help a user find the dataset of interest. Data is also provided in CSV format.</p>
        <p>CBS provides metadata for the census dataset, in both human- and machine-readable forms. A download of each dataset is available, but may leave the data user with more data than they can conveniently work with. Users are often interested only in the subset of areas that are relevant to them - such as those by flooding. CBS provides an API enabling the user to retrieve the relevant data by selecting the area of interest and, optionally, choosing specific dimensions of the statistical data.</p>
        <p>Census data naturally takes the form of a statistical 'data cube', with statistical dimensions of area, time, gender, age range etc. A useful standards-based approach to making the data available would be to represent it as RDF, using the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary [[VOCAB-DATA-CUBE]]. This offers a standards based way to represent statistical data and associated metadata as RDF. API access to the data could be provided via a SPARQL endpoint, or a more specific API. The Linked Data API, implemented by Epimorphics’ ELDA, provides a useful mechanism to expose simple RESTful APIs on top of RDF/SPARQL.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Publishing data about administrative areas</h2>
        <p>Population data from a census is typically broken down by area, gender, age (and perhaps other statistical dimensions) and relates to a particular time.</p>
        <p>CBS uses established URLs to identify each administrative area for which population data is available. Details of the administrative areas for Nieuwhaven are published by the municipal government. This information includes the geometry for each administrative area.</p>
        <p>Data about administrative areas are often useful - perhaps they represent one of the most popular spatial datasets. In this case they are useful for coordinating the emergency response, i.e. predicting and tracking which neighborhoods or districts are threatened. Because the names of local administrative areas such as neighborhoods are very well known they are also useful for communication with citizens, i.e. letting them know if their neighborhood is threatened by the flood or not.</p>
        <p>Because the administrative area datasets are quite popular, all kinds of data users will want to use it - not only GIS experts. To enable them to find the data on the web, it was published in such a way that search engines can crawl the data, making the data findable using popular search engines.</p>
        <div class="example">
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>tbd add example including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>publish administrative areas with geometry</li>
            <li>geometries published with national CRS via SDI (this could be converted in the browser using proj4.js)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Correlating statistical and geographic areas to assess impact</h2>
        <p>By cross-referencing the population statistics, administrative areas and surface water flooding extent (e.g. by calculating the intersection of the flood with administrative areas), the number of citizens impacted by each hypothetical flooding event can be estimated.</p>
        <p>Once the number of citizens that need refuge has been determined, the emergency teams can designate public buildings, such as schools and sports centers, as evacuation points and define safe transit routes to get to those points.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Publishing data about topographic features with associated discovery metadata</h2>
        <p>The municipal government published details of the built infrastructure within Nieuwhaven, including public buildings and transport infrastructure.</p>
        <div class="example">
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>tbd add example including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> each feature is uniquely identified</li>
            <li>each feature is indexed by search engines</li>
            <li>dataset is published as vector tile-set (like OSM)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The municipal government also publishes metadata describing each dataset (DWBP-BP1) that, besides free text descriptions (e.g., title, abstract), include the following information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the type of objects/features described - e.g., with a thematic classification (DWBP-BP2)</li>
          <li>spatial coverage / temporal coverage - to identify if data match the area of interest </li>
          <li>coordinate reference system(s) used - to correctly interpret geometries</li>
          <li>spatial resolution - to identify data with the right level of detail </li>
          <li>distribution format(s) and API to get access to the data (at a different level of granularity) - to identify those datasets consumable by the intended application(s) (DWBP-BP4, DWBP-BP13)</li>
          <li>date of last modification - to see whether data are up to date (DWBP-BP8) </li>
          <li>the parties responsible for the creation and maintenance of the data - to verify data authoritativeness (DWBP-BP6)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To facilitate data discoverability, metadata should be published via different channels and formats (DWBP-BP22). Nowadays, such metadata are typically maintained in geospatial catalogues, encoded based on [[ISO-19115]] - the standard for spatial metadata. In addition to this, such metadata can be served in RDF, and made queryable via a SPARQL endpoint; e.g. [[GeoDCAT-AP]] provides an XSLT-based <a href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/stash/projects/ODCKAN/repos/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/browse">mechanism</a> to automatically transform [[ISO-19115]] metadata into RDF, following a schema based on the W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary [[VOCAB-DCAT]].</p>
        <p>This solution can be further enhanced by making data discoverable and indexable via search engines. The advantage is that this would allow data consumers to discover the data even though they do not know the relevant catalogue(s), and to find alternative data sources.</p>
        <p>This can be achieved, following Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques, by embedding metadata in catalogue’s Web pages, with mechanisms like HTML-RDFa, Microdata, and Microformats. Examples of this approach include the following ones:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In the <a href="https://geo4web-testbed.github.io/topic4/">Geonovum testbed</a>, dataset pages from a spatial catalogue embed metadata, represented by using the [[SCHEMA-ORG]] vocabulary, directly generated from the relevant [[ISO-19115]] records.</li>
          <li>The <a href="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/stash/projects/ODCKAN/repos/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap/browse/api" >experimental GeoDCAT-AP API</a> allows data publishers to serve  [[ISO-19115]] records in different RDF serialization formats, including HTML+RDFa, on top of a spatial catalogue and/or an OGC Catalog Service for the Web [[CSW]].</li>

        <h2>Using spatial relations</h2>
        <p>Temporary flood defenses are common where roads and railways cross permanent flood defenses or are built up on boulevards along rivers. Also, temporary flood defenses are also deployed where dikes have not passed their annual visual inspection or 5-yearly assessment. Information regarding the condition of dikes cannot be incorporated into the plan, and must be considered during an actual flood event.</p>
        <div class="example">

          <p>tbd add examples including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>individual transport network segments and flood defense features are uniquely identified</li>
            <li>spatial relations are used to define where transport infrastructure cross flood defenses, and hence quickly determine where to deploy temporary flood defenses without the need for detailed spatial analysis … this can be used to demonstrate 3rd-party linking; e.g. the spatial relations are published by an organization that owns nether of the target datasets</li>
            <li>locations for temporary flood defenses are provided to the relevant emergency services teams</li>

        <h2>Publishing coverage data about predicted water depth</h2>
        <p>Storm surge and river flood warning services are provided by the National Water Management Centre (WMCN) at <a href="https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/">Rijkswaterstaat</a>, who are responsible for the design, construction, management and maintenance of the main infrastructure facilities in the Netherlands such as the main road network, the main waterway network and water systems.</p>
        <p>The storm surge warning service is triggered by storm surge alert from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), the Dutch national weather service. A forecast combination of heavy rainfall, high-tide and storm makes it likely that a flooding will occur in the next 120 hours. Specialists use meteorological, hydrological and urban flood prediction models within the Flood Early Warning System (FEWS) to estimate peak water-levels, when these will occur and which area will likely be flooded.</p>
        <p>The Storm surge warnings consist of predicted maximum water levels and a general description of wind and tide. 10-minute water level forecasts are computed and distributed, including details of wave run-up and overtopping for dikes.</p>
        <p>Every 6 hours, new meteorological predications are incorporated into the flood prediction, resulting in a new version of the 10-minute water level forecast dataset being made available.</p>
        <div class="example">
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>tbd add example including:</p>
          <ul>

      <section>
        <h2>Using an API to make it easy to work with spatial data</h2>
        <p>The emergency team for the Nieuwhaven safety region compare the predictions for the forecast flooding event against the hypothetical scenarios developed in the Flood Response Plan to determine which of the prepared response plans to execute.</p>
        <p>Based on this assessment, the imminent flooding event requires a number of temporary flood defenses to be deployed and evacuation of some districts of Nieuwhaven.</p>
        <p>The emergency team identify where additional temporary flood defenses are required due to any dikes that are in a state of disrepair (e.g. having failed their annual or 5-yearly assessments).</p>
        <div class="example">
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>tbd add example: </p>
          <p> cross reference the location of each damaged dike with predicted high-water level, determined via an API call into the 10-minute water level forecasts to extract a water level time-series for a given point to determine if the water level is predicted to exceed a threshold, in which case, temporary flood defenses will be required.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Making spatial data consumable by both humans and machines</h2>
        <p>Details of the emergency and the evacuation plan must be communicated to citizens. They are kept informed during and prior to the event using multiple channels:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>local radio and television networks</li>
          <li>news and media agencies; television, radio and <strong>on-line</strong></li>
          <li>official national Government website www.crisis.nl, including specific information about flooding events</li>
          <li>cell broadcasting via the Government’s NL-Alert system, providing SMS message alerts to all mobile phones in the vicinity of a life and health threatening emergency</li>
          <li>air raid sirens</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The evacuation plan must be discoverable by the public. The intent is for each plan to be both human (primarily) and machine readable. The requirement for machine readability is mostly to support automated discovery of the content via web search. The URL itself ideally should also be "human friendly" as it should be easy to share verbally in addition to being embedded and linked to from other web pages.</p>
        <p>While making the plans clear and understandable to human readers is well understood (and beyond the scope of this best practices document!). The challenge is to make the content machine readable. The use of a simple tag based schema using microdata, RDFa or JSON-LD is recommended. A simple first step might be to use the [[SCHEMA-ORG]] "<code><a href="http://schema.org/Event">schema:Event</a></code>" item tag <code>&lt;div class="event-wrapper" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Event"&gt;</code>, which has useful generic properties of date, location, duration etc. The places of evacuation refuges (e.g. schools, sports centers etc.) should be tagged using the generic "<code><a href="http://schema.org/Place">schema:Place</a></code>".</p>
        <div class="example">

        </div>
        <p>Details of the evacuation route should be provided ideally as a textual description (perhaps machine readable using the [[SCHEMA-ORG]] "TravelAction" item, although this is rather limited) and a graphical representation. Potentially route information could be encoded using a format such as <a href="http://www.openlr.org/index.html">OpenLR</a> but this has not achieved widespread adoption.</p>

        <p>News and media agencies provide Web applications that help communicate the evacuation to citizens as effectively as possible; e.g. by creating simple Web applications that direct one to the correct evacuation plan based on their postal code or online mapping tools. Media agencies may cross-reference evacuation plans with Features that have non-official identifiers; e.g. from <a href="http://what3words.com">What3Words</a> (W3W) or <a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a>.</p>

        <h2>Publishing geographic information in simple tabular data</h2>
        <p>During a flood event, the Flood Response Plan indicates that emergency services will have to focus their efforts on reducing the number of fatalities. This means that if an evacuation order is given, the efforts of the emergency services will be focused on traffic control and on non self reliant groups.</p>
        <p>As the flood event progresses, the emergency services provide evacuation assistance for the vulnerable, such as the residents of care homes. </p>
        <p>The municipal public health authority publishes details of care homes and other health care facilities on-line as open data, using a simple CSV format.</p>

        <h2>Publishing real-time data streams from sensors</h2>
        <p>During floods and storm surges, professionals (often aided by trained volunteers) constantly monitor all flood defenses. Measurements include: water level, wave height, wind speed and direction.</p>
        <p>The emergency team use these observations to monitor the rising water levels to ensure that these are consistent with the predictions (both in terms of timing and peak water-level) in case additional interventions, such as evacuating more districts, are required.</p>
        <p>A real-time data stream of water level at a specific location within Nieuwhaven’s canals is published from an automated monitoring system operated by the Water Board; e.g. a Web-enabled sensor.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, the prediction is sufficiently accurate that the evacuation plan remains effective. However, the emergency team notice that the water level in one particular sector is higher than predicted- and rising. Further analysis indicates that an automated control gate has malfunctioned.</p>
        <p>A team is dispatched to use the manual override. The manual control is located using relative positioning.</p>

        <h2>Using social media to convey spatial data</h2>
        <p>During the flood, citizens themselves become engaged with the flood event; they use social media to post geo-tagged messages regarding their observations of the flood (“the #flood has reached my home” or “Mount Pleasant Road closed at junction with Acacia Avenue #flood”, perhaps accompanied by photographs) or offer localized help (“come charge your phone at my porch #floodresponse”).</p>
        <p>The aggregated social media messages are used by the emergency team to complement the monitoring data provided by the Water Board, tracking the progress of the flooding event in near real-time.</p>
        <div class="example">
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <p>tbd add example including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>social media, water extent … VGI … <a href="https://twitter.com/leoniemellor/status/738884030511222785">https://twitter.com/leoniemellor/status/738884030511222785</a> … aggregated social media posts; situational awareness … how to reconcile place names with resources formally identified with URLs? … especially where local or informal place names (with ‘fuzzy’ boundaries) are used (e.g. “north of Downtown”)</li>
            <li>… ambiguity: “#flooding the water is 2 feet deep at my house”</li>
            <li>… social media platform providers drive collection of particular information from users of the platform</li>
            <li>… or volunteers might blog, creating content in HTML using a publishing App</li>
            <li>geotagging photos of flood extent ... using EXIF data from photos ... provide an API to search that resource [Instagram] ... emergency responders use this to track the progress of the flood against prediction</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Due to the prioritization of emergency services elsewhere, the Flood Response Plan assumes that the general public will have to be self reliant or resilient for a number of days.</p>
        <p>Using social media, local businesses offer services to those affected by the flood; for example, a local bakery offers food and water and asks for help to move these supplies to the evacuation refuge nearby.</p>
        <div class="example">

      <h2>Applicability of common formats to implementation of best practices</h2>
      <p>The Spatial Data on the Web working group is working on recommendations about the use of
        formats for publishing spatial data on the web, specifically about selecting the most
        appropriate format. There may not be one most appropriate format: which format is best may
        depend on many things. This section gives two tables that both aim to be helpful in
        selecting the right format in a given situation. These tables may in future be merged or
        reworked in other ways. </p>
      <p>The first table is a matrix of the common formats, showing in general terms how well these
        formats help achieve goals such as discoverability, granularity etc. </p>

      <h2>Authoritative sources of geographic identifiers</h2>
      <p>As per <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html"
          >https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html</a> item 4, it's useful for people to link
        their data to other related data. In this context we're most frequently talking about either
        Spatial Things and/or their geometry.</p>
      <p> There are many useful sets of identifiers for spatial things and which ones are most
        useful will depend on context. This involves discovering relevant URIs that you might want
        to connect to.</p>
      <p>Relevant URIs for spatial things can be found in many places. This list gives the first
        places you should check:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://dbpedia.org">DBpedia</a></li>
        <li>National open spatial datasets such as are made available by for example the UK and
          Dutch governments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finding out which national open spatial datasets are available, and how they can be
        accessed, currently requires prior knowledge in most cases because these datasets are often
        not easily discoverable. Look for national data portals / geoportals such as <a
          href="http://nationaalgeoregister.nl">Nationaal Georegister</a> (Dutch national register
        of spatial datasets) or <a href="https://data.overheid.nl">Dataportaal van de Nederlandse
          overheid</a> (Dutch national governmental data portal). </p>
      <div class="example">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>As an example, let's take Edinburgh. In some recent work with the Scottish Government, we
          have an identifier for the City of Edinburgh Council Area - i.e. the geographical area
          that Edinburgh City Council is responsible for:</p>
        <code>http://statistics.gov.scot/id/statistical-geography/S12000036</code>
        <p>(note that this URI doesn't resolve yet but it will in the next couple of months once the
          system goes properly live)</p>
        <p>The UK government provides an identifier for Edinburgh and/or information about it that
          we might want to link to:</p>

        <p>The Scottish identifier is directly based on this one, but the Scottish Government wanted
          the ability to create something dereferenceable, potentially with additional or different
          info to the data.gov.uk one. These two are owl:sameAs.</p>
        <p><a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh"></a></p>
        <p>DBpedia also includes a resource about Edinburgh. Relationship: "more or less the same
          as" but probably not the strict semantics of owl:sameAs.</p>

        <p>This Edinburgh resource is found by querying the OS gazetteer search service for
          'Edinburgh' then checking the labels of the results that came up. OS give it a type of
          'NamedPlace' and give it some coordinates.</p>

        <p>This Edinburgh airport resource was also found by the same OS gazetteer search service
          for 'Edinburgh'. This is clearly not the same as the original spatial thing, but you might
          want to say something like 'within' or 'hasAirport'.</p>

        <p>This resource is in the OS 'Boundary Line' service that contains administrative and
          statistical geography areas in the UK. It's probably safe to say the original identifier
          is owl:sameAs this one.</p>

      <p><dfn data-lt="Coverage|Coverages|Coverage Function">Coverage</dfn>: A coverage is a function that describe characteristics of real-world phenomena that vary over space and/or time. Typical examples are temperature, elevation and precipitation. A coverage is typically represented as a data structure containing a set of such values, each associated with one of the elements in a spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal domain. Typical spatial domains are point sets (e.g. sensor locations), curve sets (e.g. contour lines), grids (e.g. orthoimages, elevation models), etc. A property whose value varies as a function of time may be represented as a temporal coverage or time-series [[ISO-19109]] §8.8.</p>

        geocoding, often just referred to as geocoding, is the process of converting addresses into
        geographic coordinates. Reverse geocoding is the opposite process; converting geographic
        coordinates to addresses. <span style="background-color:yellow">Compare with the <a

        which subdivides space into buckets. Geohashes offer properties like arbitrary precision and
        the possibility of gradually removing characters from the end of the code to reduce its size
        (and gradually lose precision). As a consequence of the gradual precision degradation,
        nearby places will often (but not always) present similar prefixes. The longer a shared

        a small set of formatting rules for the portable representation of structured data.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="latitude|lat">Latitude</dfn>: The angular distance north or south of the equator. Often abbreviated to <em>Lat</em>.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="link|links">Link</dfn>: A typed connection between two resources that are
        identified by Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [[RFC3987]], and is comprised
        of: (i) a context IRI, (ii) a link relation type, (iii) a target IRI, and (iv) optionally,
        target attributes. Note that in the common case, the IRI will also be a URI [[RFC3986]],

          (OWA)</dfn>: In a formal system of logic used for knowledge representation, the open-world
        assumption asserts that the truth value of a statement may be true irrespective of whether
        or not it is known to be true. This assumption codifies the informal notion that in general
        no single agent or observer has complete knowledge. In essence, from the absence of a
        statement alone, a deductive reasoner cannot (and must not) infer that the statement is
        false. <span style="background-color:yellow"><a

        across diverse data sources [[SPARQL11-OVERVIEW]].</p>
      <p><dfn>Spatial data</dfn>: Data describing anything with spatial extent; i.e. size, shape or
        position. In addition to describing things that are positioned relative to the Earth (also
        see geospatial data), spatial data may also describe things using other coordinate systems
        that are not related to position on the Earth, such as the size, shape and positions of
        cellular and sub-cellular features described using the 2D or 3D Cartesian coordinate system
        of a specific tissue sample.</p>
      <p><dfn>Spatial database</dfn>: A spatial database, or geodatabase, is a database that is
        optimized to store and query data that represents objects defined in a geometric space. Most
        spatial databases allow representation of simple geometric objects such as points, lines and
        polygons and provide functions to determine spatial relationships (overlaps, touches
        etc.).</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="SDI|SDIs|Spatial Data Infrastructure|Spatial Data Infrastructures">SDI</dfn>:
        An ecosystem of geographic data, metadata, tools, applications, policies and users that are
        necessary to acquire, process, distribute, use, maintain, and preserve spatial data. Due to
        its nature (size, cost, number of interactors) an SDI is often government-related.</p>

      <section id="changes-since-20160119">
        <h2>Changes since the first public working draft of 19 January 2016</h2>
        <p>The document has undergone substantial changes since the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-sdw-bp-20160119/">first public working draft</a>. Below are some of the changes made:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Focusing the document to suit the needs of practitioners: those either publishing spatial data themselves, or developing software tools to support the publication of spatial data (see sections <a href="#audience"></a> and <a href="#scope"></a>)</li>
          <li>Addition of new introductory material to explain the fundamentals of spatial data to readers (see sections <a href="#spatial-things-features-and-geometry"></a>, <a href="#coverages"></a>, <a href="#spatial-relations"></a>, <a href="#linked-data"></a> and <a href="#why-are-traditional-sdi-not-enough"></a>)</li>
          <li>Consolidation of the best practices from 30 down to 17 - based on merging duplicate or closely related best practices and focusing our scope only on spatial data concerns so that, for example, best practices relating to handling sensor data are removed (we expect these subjects to be included in future iterations of the Sensor Network deliverables of the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">working group</a>)</li>
          <li>Alignment of the remaining best practices with those from [[DWBP]] - including organizing them according to the same sub-section headings</li>
          <li>As a consequence of the consolidation and [[DWBP]] alignment, the best practices are renumbered (although the fragment-identifiers remain unchanged from those used in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-sdw-bp-20160119/">first public working draft</a>) and the cross-reference to the Requirements from [[SDW-UCR]] (section <a href="#requirements"></a>) has been updated</li>
          <li>Addition of a new, partially complete section (see <a href="#how-to-use"></a>) that is intended to help readers understand the steps they should take and the questions they should consider when publishing spatial data on the Web; referencing both the general [[DWBP]] best practices and those specific to spatial data described in this document</li>
          <li>Improvements to the <a href="#glossary"></a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Section <a href="#narrative"></a> has also be introduced in this draft in an attempt to provide a context for the best practices using an end-to-end narrative based on an urban flooding event. This introduces a number of case studies that are intended to illustrate how the challenges associated with publishing different kinds of spatial data on the Web may be approached. This draft includes only the overview for each case study and does not (yet) describe the activities that each actor should undertake in order to publish their spatial data.</p>
