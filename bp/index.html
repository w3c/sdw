      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <section id="intro-general">
        <h3>General introduction</h3>
          <p>To quote the [[DWBP]], there is a growing interest in publishing and consuming data on the Web. Very often the common factor across multiple datasets is the location data. Spatial data, or data related to a specific location, is what this Best Practice is all about. </p>
          <p>There's already a lot of spatial data on the web. Everone knows the maps, satellite and street level images offered by search engines. There are many nice examples of spatial data being used in web applications. </p>
          <aside class="example"><a href="http://sfpark.org/">SF Park</a> is a website where users can look on a map of San Francisco to see where parking is available and at what price. Parking prices are incrementally raised or lowered in SFpark pilot areas based on demand. In this application, static data on existing parking spaces is combined with changing data about where people park the most, which is measured by parking sensors. </aside>
          <p>Different groups of people have a need for spatial data on the web. </p>
          <p><em>Commercial operators, including search engines</em>, invest a great deal of time and effort in generating geographical databases which are mirrors to Web content with the geographical context often added manually or at best semi-automatically. This process would be substantially aided if data were published on the Web with the appropriate geographic information at the source, thus allowing discovery and access using the standard mechanisms of the Web.</p>
          <p><em>Geospatial experts</em> who try to find and use data published in <abbr title="Spatial Data Infrastructure">SDI</abbr>s, can get frustrated by the fact that most web services available for spatial data are in fact <abbr title="Web Mapping Service">WMS</abbr> services, which serve static pictures, not data. <abbr title="web feature service">WFS</abbr> services, which allow you to get data, also exist, but are far less common. One could ask: do we really have a spatial data infrastructure or is it mostly just a 'spatial picture infrastructure'? </p>
          <p class="note">If you're not a geospatial expert, this may be the first you hear about SDI, WMS and WFS. But in fact, there is a whole world of geospatial standards, maintained by the <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr>, aimed at publishing geospatial data in a related series of standardized web services and processing it with specialized tools. </p>
          <p>The intended users of the SDI are experts in the geospatial domain. The OGC standards cover the full range of geospatial use cases – some of which are very complex. Because of this, it requires significant expertise in geospatial information technology to be able to use the SDI.</p>
          <p>For <em>web developers</em>, who come from outside the geospatial domain, the data behind the OGC services is part of the “Deep Web” - the data is published behind specialized web services and not easy to get at, unless you're an expert. But web developers are increasingly creating and using data related to locations, so they are an important factor for geospatial data.</p>
          <p>The <em>public sector</em> creates a lot of geospatial data, a lot of which is open data and could be useful to others, who may or may not be geospatial data experts. In addition, geospatial data is becoming more and more important for the web and its importance is still growing, among other things because of the rise of the internet of things. And this importance is far beyond serving static ‘pixels’. Semantically meaningful information on objects is required. </p>
          <p>In short, there is a large demand for spatial data on the web. But there are some questions around publishing spatial data on the web that keep popping up and need to be answered. One is that many relevant standards already exist. These include informal 'community standards' - geospatial formats and/or vocabularies that enjoy widespread adoption (GeoJSON being the prime example) and others for which the formal standardization process has not been completed. Where standards have been completed there are competing ideas and engineers are often unsure which ones to adopt. With these factors in mind, this Best Practice  aims to clarify and formalize the relevant standards landscape.</p>
          <p>Questions answered in this document include how spatial information can best be integrated with other data on the Web; how machines and people can discover that different facts in different datasets relate to the same place, especially when 'place' is expressed in different ways and at different levels of granularity; how spatial aspects of metadata can be provided; and many other things.</p>

        <h3>Difference between spatial data on the web and current SDI practice</h3>
        </section>
        
        <section id="intro-principles">
        <h3>Principles</h3>
          <p>We will not reinvent; the best practices in this document are based on what is already there. The added value is that they are assembled here.</p>
          <p>The last thing we want is for this to become a 'best theories' document. This Best Practices document takes its examples and solutions from what is being done in practice right now. In other words, it is as much as possible evidence based. This document will also describe 'emerging practices' when no established solutions can be found in practice yet. Best versus emerging practices will be clearly recognizable in this document.</p>
          <p>This document complies as much as possible with the principles of the [[LD-BP]] and the (developing) [[DWBP]]. Where it does not, this will be identified and explained.</p>
          <p>Best practices have to be visible. This means: We will link to at least one (or two, three) publicly available example(s) of a non-toy dataset that follows the best practice.</p>
          <p>There should be many (small) examples in the Best Practices, as examples can be a good way of communicating an idea and are a good way to start an implementation.</p>
          <p class="note">The Principles section is mainly written for the Spatial Data on the Web working group itself; this section will be removed from this document. Some of the text might go into other sections.  </p>

    <section id="audience" class="informative">
      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>The introduction makes clear that we have multiple groups of potential users in mind with this document. One of these groups is the geospatial expert, and another is the web developer with no specific geospatial expertise. The first group can work with <abbr>WFS</abbr>; the second are better served with simpler interfaces in a more webby fashion. The audience is the broadest community of web users possible, application and tool builders addressing the needs to the mass consumer market should find value and guidance in the document. </p>

        <h3>Geospatial experts without web knowledge</h3>

      <section id="audience-web-developers">
        <h3>Web developers without geospatial knowledge</h3>
        <p>An aim of this document is making it easy for non-experts to work (find, publish, use) with spatial data on the web. Web application developers who just (!) want to use spatial data should not need to become GIS experts; spatial data is just one facet of the information space they work with, so let's not make it special by requiring up front knowledge.</p>
      </section>
        
      <section id="audience-content-publishers">
        <h3>Content publishers</h3>
        <p>The first two audience groups mentioned are user types; but spatial data publishers are a third important audience for this document. They want to know how to publish their spatial data in order for it to get used to its full potential.

      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This document is about spatial data on the web. Practices about publishing data in general on the web are out of scope. Sometimes they are mentioned in this document and general examples are given, together with references to relevant resources about publishing data on the web in general. </p>
      <p>Spatial data can be data that has an explicit geometry as a property, but this is not necessarily the case. Data about a place is spatial data even if no explicit geometry can be given for this place. </p>
      <p>It's out of scope for this document: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>As already mentioned: to give best practices about publishing data in general on the web.</li>
        <li>To give best practices for displaying spatial data on maps.</li>

            <li>in order for identifiers to be useful, people should be comfortable creating them themselves (bottom up, like hashtags) and this BP will give some pointers about how to create good URIs (should be dereferenceable/resolvable). There is no top down authority that you have to go to in order to create identifiers for spatial objects. So just make them up yourself if you need them and they don't exist.</li>
            <li>how to mint the identifier yourself based on the features in your dataset and how the identifier is for the real 
              world thing the feature describes. Local names are not typically URIs. We know we want to use URIs as identifiers. So we might take the dataset URI -
              which identifies a silo ... think of a different dataset, this one about shipwrecks near lighthouses. But problem is mapping the local IDs, we want to 
              be able to express the linkages within the dataset</li>

            (e.g. two mentions of Paris are talking about the same place), and are not addressing thematic reconciliation. </p>

        <h3>Expressing spatial data</h3>
        <p>It is important to publish your spatial data with clear semantics. The primary use case for this is you already have a database of assets and you want to publish the semantics of this data. Another use case is someone wanting to publish some information wich has a spatial component on the web in a form that search engines will understand. </p>
       
        
        <p>The spatial thing itself and its geometry property also has semantics. We may describe that here or in the Expressing geo section. </p>
        <p>How should I publish my vocabulary? This question is answered in the [[LD-BP]] document. We recommend that you link your own vocabulary to commonly used existing ones because it increases its usefulness. How to do this is out of scope for this document; however, we give some examples of mapping relations you can use from OWL, SKOS, RDFS. And we do the mapping between some commonly used spatial vocabularies. </p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>The current list of RDF vocabularies / OWL ontologies for spatial data being considered by the SDW WG are provided below. Some of these will be used in examples. Full details, including mapping between vocabularies, will be published in a complementary NOTE [tbd].</p>

        <p>about representations changing over time: administrative boundaries and catchment datasets as examples of how you shouldn't create new objects when for some reason the records change while the real world thing stays the same. Dataset owners need to be aware of this.</p>
        <p>(here or in a different section) A list/matrix of the common formats (GeoJSON, GML, RDF, JSON-LD) and what you can or can't achieve with it.</p>
        <p class="note">Possible gap in best practice and something we might recommend (as a recommended way) even though we don't label it a best practice: we may need to come up with a new sameAs which is a spatial:samePlaceAs. If we feel that the lack of that expression is impeding getting spatial data on the web. Not meaning spatial intersection, but the social notion of different communities or people talking about a place and meaning the same place. 'placial instead of spatial view'. </p>
        <p>Using sameAs to establish that two resources are about the same thing. These sameAs statements could be collected into one set and this set could have provenance so that you can see who created the sameAs statements and decide if you'd trust them. </p>

            <p>Links enable a network of related resources to be connected together. For those connections to remain useful over a long period of time, both origin and target resources need to have durable identifiers. Typically, it is the spatial Things that are given durable identifiers (see <a href="#globally-unique-ids">Best Practice 1: Use globally unique identifiers for entity-level resources</a>) whereas the information resources that describe them (e.g. geometry objects) may be replaced by new versions.</p>

        <h3>Enabling discovery</h3>
        <p style="background-color:yellow">This section is about <em>using</em> links for discovery, whereas <a href="#bp-linking" class="sectionRef"></a> is concerned with <em>creating</em> links.</p>
        <p>SDIs only allow discovery at the dataset level but not at the data level (the spatial things and their properties), which is wat we want. Metadata on both the dataset and the data level are useful, and we recommend not to keep them separate (like in an SDI) but together. </p>
        <p>The current OGC WxS services need some form of redesign (perhaps in the form of an extra layer on top aka a shim) in order to make it more discoverable and the data inside linkable. I.e. make crawlable pages to improve discovery. </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="35">The Data on the Web Best Practice is addressing discovery at the dataset level including spatial and temporal coverage.</p>
        <p>GeoDCAT-AP is a spatial extension to DCAT which can help improve discovery of datasets. (see also <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sdw/issues/35">ISSUE 35</a>).</p>
        <p>One way of discovering is browsing through data using semantics; which allows you to find related data through semantic similarity.</p>
        <p>Linksets are useful for making links between entities in the dataset discoverable and crawlable. Using linksets are one example of doing that at the dataset level, a third party making collections of links browsable and allowing discovery of backlinks.  Note that this is an emerging practice, not an established one.  Also address here: how do you deal with maintaining links over time (when resources you link to may change or disappear). Example: OpenPHACTS. </p>
        <p class="issue" data-number="36">This needs further discussion. Linksets does not seem to be an evidence-based best practice. It might be an emerging practice; CSIRO example. This might go in a shared note with the DWBP. An example of expressing a collection of links from the library community is <a href="https://gbv.github.io/beaconspec/beacon.html">here</a>. An example vocabulary for expressing link sets is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/void/#describing-linksets">in VoID</a>.</p>
        <p>Datacubes can have a dimension which is a place name from a gazetteer and this allows the discovery of thematic data about a place.</p>
        <p>Some data is behind a paywall or security because of privacy. Metadata for such datasets should be published in a way that it is crawlable even though the data itself is not within reach of the crawler. There are practices existing for this; the SDWBP will point to them.</p>

        <p class="note">Dataset-level discovery is covered by DWBP <span style="background-color:yellow">[ref?]</span>; <em>spatial</em> data is typically more structured and contains Things that can be discovered individually</p>

        <p>There's no best practice for exposing Web Feature Service content in a more accessible way from a linked data point of view. However we describe here a recommended way of doing it, giving each feature its own stable URI and extending the API to make it more discoverable.  </p>
        <p>The current OGC WxS services need some form of redesign (perhaps in the form of an extra layer on top aka a shim) in order to make it more discoverable and the data inside linkable. To make the data inside a service more linkable stable URIs need to be minted for the spatial things in the service and be made available.
