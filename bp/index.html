      <p>This document advises on best practices related to the publication of spatial
        data on the Web; the use of Web technologies <em>as they may be applied to location</em>.
        The best practices presented here are intended for practitioners, including Web developers and geospatial
        experts, and are compiled based on evidence of real-world application. These best practices
        suggest a significant change of emphasis from traditional <a>Spatial Data Infrastructures</a> by
        adopting an approach based on general Web standards. As location is often the common factor across multiple
        datasets, <a>spatial data</a> is an especially useful addition to the Web of data.</p>

      <p><strong>For <abbr title="Open Geospatial Consortium">OGC</abbr>:</strong> This is a Public
        Draft of a document prepared by the Spatial Data on the Web Working Group (<a
          href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">SDWWG</a>) - a joint W3C-OGC
        project (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter">charter</a>). The document is
        prepared following W3C conventions. The document is released to solicit public
        comment.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Increasing numbers of Web applications provide a means of accessing data. From simple
        visualizations to sophisticated interactive tools, there is a growing reliance on data. The
        open data movement has led to many national, regional and local governments publishing
        their data through portals. Scientific and cultural heritage data is increasingly published
        on the Web for reuse by others. Crowd-sourced and social media data are abundant on the Web.
        Sensors, connected devices and services from domains such as energy, transport,
        manufacturing and healthcare are becoming commonly integrated using the Web as a common data
        sharing platform.</p>
      <p>The Data on the Web Best Practices [[DWBP]] provide a set of recommendations that are
        applicable to the publication of <em>all</em> types of data on the Web. Those best practices
        cover aspects including data formats, data access, data identifiers, metadata, licensing and
        provenance.</p>
      <p>Within this document, we are concerned with <a>spatial data</a>: data that describes <em>anything</em> with spatial <a>extent</a> (i.e. size, shape or position). <a>Spatial data</a> is also known as <em>location information</em>.</p>
      <p>Similarly to the challenges identified in [[DWBP]] relating to publishing data on the Web,
        and therefore not making use of the full potential of the Web as a data sharing platform,
        there is a lack of consistency in how people publish <a>spatial data</a>.</p>
      <p>It is not that there is a lack of <a>spatial data</a> on the Web; the maps, satellite and street
        level images offered by search engines are familiar and there are many more examples of
        spatial data being used in Web applications.</p>
      <aside class="example" id="ex-sfpark" title="SFpark"><a href="http://sfpark.org/">SFpark</a>
        is a Web site where users can look at a map of San Francisco to see where parking is
        available and at what price. Parking prices are incrementally raised or lowered in SFpark
        pilot areas based on demand. In this application, static data on existing parking spaces is
        combined with changing data about where people park the most, which is measured by parking
        sensors.</aside>
      <p>However, the data that has been published is difficult to find and often problematic to
        access for non-specialist users. The key problems we are trying to solve in this document
        are discoverability, accessibility and interoperability. Our overarching goal is to enable
        <a>spatial data</a> to be integrated within the wider Web of data; providing standard patterns and
        solutions that help solve these problems.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="audience" class="informative">
      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>Our goal in writing this best practice document is to support the practitioners who are
        responsible for publishing their <a>spatial data</a> on the Web or developing tools to make it easy
        for others to work with spatial data.</p>
      <p>We expect readers to be familiar both with the fundamental concepts of the architecture of
        the Web [[WEBARCH]] and the generalized best practices related to the publication and usage
        of data on the Web [[DWBP]].</p>
      <p>We aim to provide two primary pathways into these best practices:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>for those already familiar with publishing data on the Web who want to better exploit
          the spatial aspects of their data; and</li>
        <li>for those who publish <a>spatial data</a> through <a>Spatial Data Infrastructures</a> and want to
          better integrate that data within the wider Web ecosystem.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In each case, we aim to help them provide incremental value to their data through
        application of these best practices.</p>
      <p>This document provides a wide range of examples that illustrate how these best practices
        may be applied using specific technologies. We do not expect readers to be familiar with all
        the technologies used herein; rather that readers can identify with the activities being
        undertaken in the various examples and, in doing so, find relevant technologies that they
        are already aware of or discover technologies that are new to them.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="scope" class="informative">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <section id="scope-spatialdata">
        <h3>Spatial data</h3>
        <p>All the best practices described in [[DWBP]] are relevant to publication of <a>spatial data</a>
        on the Web. Some, such as [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#DataLicense">Best Practice 4: Provide data license information</a> 
        need no further elaboration in the context of <a>spatial data</a>.
        However, other best practices from [[DWBP]] are further refined in this document to provide
        more specific guidance for <a>spatial data</a>.</p>
      <p>The best practices described below are intended to meet requirements derived from the
        scenarios in [[SDW-UCR]] that describe how <a>spatial data</a> in commonly published and used on
        the Web.</p>
      <p>In line with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter#bp">charter</a>, this
        document provides advice on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The choice of vocabulary and data format to be used when encoding <a>spatial data</a>;</li>
        <li>The use of URIs for identifiers of resources described in spatial data;</li>
        <li>The use of metadata to complement spatial data; and</li>
        <li>The use of APIs to expose spatial data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As stated in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter#bp">charter</a>, discussion of activities relating to rendering <a>spatial data</a> as maps is explicitly out of scope.</p>
        <p>The original intent of these best practices was to cover aspects relating to all types of <a>spatial data</a>, for example: the arrangement of cells on a microscope slide; the position of things on the surface of the Earth, the Moon, Mars or other celestial bodies; the position of planets in the solar system etc. However, due to resource limitations these best practices deal almost exclusively with <a>geospatial data</a>; data about things that are implicitly or explicitly located relative to the Earth. That said, many of the best practices are applicable to wider <a>spatial data</a> concerns. In the remainder of the document, we simply refer to <a>spatial data</a> for brevity.</p>
      <p>We extend [[DWBP]] to cover aspects specifically relating to <a>spatial data</a>,
        introducing new best practices only where necessary. In particular, we consider the
        individual resources, or <a>Spatial Things</a>, that are described within a dataset.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="scope-datapub">
        <h3>Data publication</h3>
        <p>In this document, we focus on the needs of data publishers and the developers that provide tools for them. That said, we recognize that value can only be gained from <em>publishing</em> the <a>spatial data</a> when people <em>use</em> it! Although we do not directly address the needs of those users, we ask that data publishers and developers reading this document do not forget about them; moreover, that they always consider the needs of users when publishing spatial data or developing the supporting tools. All our best practices are intended to provide guidance about publishing <a>spatial data</a> to improve ease of use.</p>
        <p>Neither the wider topic of spatial data <em>management</em> nor <a>Spatial Data Infrastructures</a> are covered. We assume that your spatial data already exists and will be available from one of the following places:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>plain text documents; e.g. historical texts, government reports, blog posts etc.</li>
          <li>data files containing structured content or markup; e.g. geospatial vector data in Shapefile or [[GML]] format, statistical data in tabular <a>CSV</a> format or a spreadsheet, as GPX data with “waypoints” and “tracks”, satellite imagery in GeoTIFF, climate simulations in CF-NetCDF etc.</li>
          <li>a data repository; e.g. PostGIS (a spatially enabled relational database), Elasticsearch (a document-oriented noSQL repository based on Apache Lucene), Apache Jena’s TDB (an RDF <a>triple store</a>)</li>
          <li>exposed via an existing API; including OGC-compliant Web services such as <a>WFS</a> [[WFS]] and <a>WCS</a> [[WCS]].</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If your <a>spatial data</a> is managed within a software system it is likely that you will be able to access that data through one or more of the methods identified above; as structured data from a bulk extract (e.g. a “data dump”), via direct access to the underpinning data repository or through a bespoke or standards-compliant API provided by the system.</p>

        <p>Each of the four starting points outlined above have their own challenges, but working with plain text documents can be particularly tricky as you will need to parse the natural language to identify the <a>Spatial Things</a> and their properties before you can proceed any further. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a complex topic in its own right and is beyond the scope of this best practice document. We will assume that you’ve already completed this step and have parsed any plain documents into structured data records of some kind.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="best-practice-criteria">
        <h3>Best practice criteria</h3>
        <p>The best practices described in this document are compiled based on evidence of real-world
          application in production environments. By ‘production environment’ we mean a case where <a>spatial data</a> has been delivered on the Web with the intention of being used by end users and with a quality level expected from such data. Where the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">Working
          Group</a> have identified issues that inhibit the use or interoperability of spatial data
        on the Web, yet no evidence of real-world application is available, the editors present
        these issues to the reader for consideration, along with any approaches recommended by the
        Working Group. Please see <a href="#conclusions" class="sectionRef"></a> for further details. Such recommendations are clearly distinguished as such to ensure
        that they are not confused with evidence-based best practice.</p>
      <p>The normative element of each best practice is the <em>intended outcome</em>. Possible
        implementations are suggested and, where appropriate, these recommend the use of a
        particular technology.</p>
      <p>We intend this best practice to be durable; that is that the best practices remain relevant
        for many years to come as the specific technologies change. However, to provide
        actionable guidance, i.e. to provide readers with the technical information they need to get
        their <a>spatial data</a> on the Web, we try to balance between durable advice (that is necessarily
        general) and examples using currently available technologies that illustrate how these best
        practices can be implemented. We expect that readers will continue to be able to derive
        insight from the examples even when those specifically mentioned technologies are no longer
        in common usage, understanding that technology ‘y’ has replaced technology ‘x’.</p></section>
      <section id="scope-privacy">
        <h3>Privacy considerations</h3>
        <p>There are many situations where the location of a person is very useful; from using a taxi hailing service to <a>geocoding</a> a selfie. Technology makes this location information easy to collect and share. However, <a>spatial data</a> has particular characteristics which makes its use potentially more complex. For example, a single location of an anonymous tracked mobile phone may cause few privacy concerns, however the same phone tracked over a few days could provide enough information to make the identification of its user possible. Like all personally identifiable information, great care must be taken as the collection, management and security of such information is the subject of legal frameworks. We do not attempt to provide guidance as to legal aspects of storing potentially personally identifiable spatial information; expert legal advice should be obtained. In summary: legal and privacy considerations relating to spatial data are out of scope.</p>

      <h2>Spatial Things, Features and Geometry</h2>
      <p>In spatial data standards from the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org">Open
          Geospatial Consortium</a> (OGC) and the 19100 series of ISO <a>geographic information</a>
        standards from <a href="http://www.isotc211.org">ISO/TC 211</a> the primary entity is the
          <a>feature</a>. [[ISO-19101]] defines a feature
        as an: “abstraction of real world phenomena”.</p>
      <p>This terse definition is a little confusing, so let’s unpack it.</p>
      <p>Firstly, it talks about “real world phenomena”; that’s everything from highways to
        helicopters, parking meters to postcode areas, water bodies to weather fronts and more.
        These can be physical things that you can touch (e.g. a phone box) or an abstract concept
        that has spatial <a>extent</a> (e.g. a postcode area). <a>Features</a> can even be fictional (e.g.
        “Dickensian London”) and may even lack any concrete location information such as the
        mythical Atlantis.</p>
      <p>The key point is that these “features” are things that one talks about in the <a>universe
          of discourse</a> - which is defined in [[ISO-19101]] as the “view of the real or hypothetical world that includes
        everything of interest”.</p>
      <p>Secondly, the definition of <a>feature</a> talks about “abstraction”. Take the example of <a
          href="https://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses-and-lightvessels/eddystone-lighthouse">Eddystone Lighthouse</a>. A helicopter pilot
        might see it a “vertical obstruction” and be interested in attributes such as its height and
        precise location. Whereas a sailor may see it as a “maritime navigation aid” and need
        information about its light characteristic and general location. Depending on one’s set of
        concerns, only a subset of the attributes of a given “real world phenomenon” are relevant.
        In the case of Eddystone Lighthouse, we defined two separate “abstractions”. As is common
        practice in many information modelling activities, the common sets of attributes for a given
        “abstraction” are used to define <em>classes</em>. In the parlance of [[ISO-19101]], such a class is known as “feature
        type”. </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Although the exact semantics differ a little, there is a good correlation between the
          concept of “feature type” as defined in spatial data standards and the concept
          of “class” defined in [[RDF-SCHEMA]]. The former is an information modelling construct that
          binds a fixed set of attributes to an identified resource, whereas the latter defines the
          set of all resources that share the same group of attributes.</p>
        <p>When combined with the <a>open-world assumption</a> embraced by [[RDF-SCHEMA]] and the Web
          Ontology Language (OWL) [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]], the set-based approach to classes provides more
          flexibility when combining information from multiple sources. For example, the “Eddystone
          Lighthouse” resource can be seen as <em>both</em> a “vertical obstruction” <em>and</em> a
          “maritime navigation aid” as it meets the criteria for membership of both sets.
          Conversely, this flexibility makes it much more difficult to build software applications
          as there is no guarantee that an information resource will specify a given attribute. Web
          standards such the Shapes Constraint Language [[SHACL]] are being defined to remedy this
          issue.</p>
      </div>
      <p>However, the term “feature” is also commonly used to mean a capability of a system, application or component. Also, in some domains and/or applications no distinction is made between "<a>feature</a>" and the corresponding real-world phenomena.</p>

      <p>To avoid confusion, we adopt the term “<a>Spatial Thing</a>” throughout the remainder of this best practice document. “<a>Spatial thing</a>” is defined in [[W3C-BASIC-GEO]] as “Anything with spatial extent, i.e. size, shape, or position. e.g. people, places, bowling balls, as well as abstract areas like cubes”.</p>

      <p>The concept of “<a>Spatial Thing</a>” is considered to include <em>both</em> "real-world phenomena" <em>and</em> their abstractions (e.g. “<a>feature</a>” as defined in [[ISO-19101]]). Furthermore, we treat it as inclusive of other commonly used definitions; e.g. <strong>Feature</strong> from [[NeoGeo]], described as “A geographical feature, capable of holding spatial relations”.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>A <a>Spatial Thing</a> may move. We must take care not to oversimplify our concept of <a>Spatial Thing</a> by assuming that it is equivalent to definitions such as <strong>Location</strong> (from [[DCTERMS]]) or <strong>Place</strong> (from [[SCHEMA-ORG]]), which are respectively described as “A spatial region or named place” and "Entities that have a somewhat fixed, physical extension".</p>
      </div>
      <p>Looking more closely, it is important to note that <a>geometry</a> is typically a property of a <a>Spatial
          Thing</a>.</p>
      <pre class="example" id="ex-eddystone-geometry" title="Eddystone Lighthouse geometry (encoded as GeoJSON [RFC7946])">
{
  “geometry”: {
    “type”: “Point”,
    “coordinates”: [50.184, -4.268]
  }
}
      </pre>
      <p>In fact, this is only one <a>geometry</a> that may be used to describe Eddystone Lighthouse. Other geometries might include a 2D polygon that defines the footprint of the lighthouse in a horizontal plane and a 3D solid describing the volumetric shape of the lighthouse.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, these geometries may be subject to change due to, say, a resurvey of the lighthouse. In such a situation, the <a>geometry</a> object would be updated- but the <a>Spatial Thing</a> that we are talking about is still Eddystone Lighthouse. Following the best practices presented below, we use a HTTP URI to unambiguously identify Eddystone Lighthouse: <a href="https://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses-and-lightvessels/eddystone-lighthouse"><code>https://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses-and-lightvessels/eddystone-lighthouse</code></a>.</p> 

      <div class="note">
        <p>In fact, there are many URIs in use for Eddystone Lighthouse. The one above is provided by the owners/operators of the lighthouse; others include <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q546122"><code>https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q546122</code></a> from <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a>, <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eddystone_Lighthouse"><code>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eddystone_Lighthouse</code></a> from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/">DBPedia</a> and <a href="http://d-nb.info/gnd/1067162240"><code>http://d-nb.info/gnd/1067162240</code></a> from <a href="http://www.dnb.de/">Deutsche Nationalbibliothek</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <p>We say that the <a>Spatial Thing</a> is disjoint from the <a>geometry</a> object. The <a>Spatial Thing</a>, Eddystone Lighthouse (<a href="https://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses-and-lightvessels/eddystone-lighthouse"><code>https://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouses-and-lightvessels/eddystone-lighthouse</code></a>), is the “real world phenomenon” about which we want to state facts (such as the height of its light is 41 meters above sea level) and link to other real world phenomena (for example, that it is located at Eddystone Rocks, Cornwall; another <a>Spatial Thing</a> identified as <a href="http://sws.geonames.org/2650253/"><code>http://sws.geonames.org/2650253/</code></a> by <a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a>).</p>

      <p>Sometimes <a>Spatial Things</a>, such as <a href="http://sws.geonames.org/2212709/">The Sahara</a>, have imprecisely defined locations. These are still considered to be <a>Spatial Things</a> as they have spatial <a>extent</a> &mdash; it's just that we can't define a crisp vector boundary for them because there's no consensus about where the edges are. In such cases, often a single point is given that provides the notional center-point of the Spatial Thing.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>Although we have borrowed the description of <a>Spatial Thing</a> from [[W3C-BASIC-GEO]], the formal [[RDF-SCHEMA]] definition of <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing"><code>w3cgeo:SpatialThing</code></a> doesn't quite suit our purpose as there is the potential for confusion about whether it is <em>disjoint</em> from <a>geometry</a>. The definition of <a href="http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#Feature"><code>geosparql:Feature</code></a>, which is derived from the [[ISO-19109]] definition of <a>Feature</a>, is a better semantic fit for <a>Spatial Thing</a> as it is explicitly specified as being disjoint from <a href="http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#Geometry"><code>geosparql:Geometry</code></a>.</p>

        <p>First, the domain of <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#lat"><code>w3cgeo:lat</code></a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#lon"><code>w3cgeo:lon</code></a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#alt"><code>w3cgeo:alt</code></a> properties is <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing"><code>w3cgeo:SpatialThing</code></a>. While one could interpret these properties as mapping to a <a>geometry</a>, as <a href="http://www.georss.org/simple">GeoRSS Simple</a> does, there isn't conclusive evidence that this is what was intended. Second, <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#Point"><code>w3cgeo:Point</code></a> is defined as a sub-class of <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing"><code>w3cgeo:SpatialThing</code></a>. As a result, we have inconsistency in how <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing"><code>w3cgeo:SpatialThing</code></a> may be interpreted. For example:</p>

          <li>Because a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing"><code>w3cgeo:SpatialThing</code></a> has lat/lon, some people might equate <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing"><code>w3cgeo:SpatialThing</code></a> with <a href="http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#Geometry"><code>geosparql:Geometry</code></a>;</li>
          <li>Because <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"><code>foaf:Person</code></a> is defined as a sub-class of <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing"><code>w3cgeo:SpatialThing</code></a>, some other people find it natural to equate <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing"><code>w3cgeo:SpatialThing</code></a> with <a href="http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#Feature"><code>geosparql:Feature</code></a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>So in summary, it's safer to say that our <a>Spatial Thing</a> equates to <a href="http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#Feature"><code>geosparql:Feature</code></a>, and that it is <strong>not</strong> the same as <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#SpatialThing"><code>w3cgeo:SpatialThing</code></a>.</p>

      <h2>Coverages: describing properties that vary with location (and time)</h2>
      <p>Many aspects of <a>Spatial Things</a> can be described with single-valued, static properties. However, in some applications it is more useful to describe the variation of property values in space and time. Such descriptions are formalized as <a>coverages</a>. Users of spatial information may employ both viewpoints.</p>

      <p>So what is a <a>coverage</a>? As defined by [[ISO-19123]] it is simply a data structure that maps points in space and time to property values. For example, an aerial photograph can be thought of as a coverage that maps positions on the ground to colors. A river gauge maps points in time to flow values. A weather forecast maps points in space and time to values of temperature, wind speed, humidity and so forth. One way to think of a coverage is as a mathematical function, where data values are a function of coordinates in space and time.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>Sometimes you’ll hear the word “<a>coverage</a>” used synonymously with “gridded data” or “raster data” but this isn’t really accurate. You can see from the above paragraph that non-gridded data (like a river gauge measurement) can also be modelled as coverages. Nevertheless, you will often find a bias toward gridded data in discussions (and software) that concern coverages.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Although the definition above presents a <a>coverage</a> as a data structure, conceptually it still has spatial <a>extent</a>. For example, the distribution of rainfall measured by a weather radar can be thought of as a coverage &mdash; the spatial extent is defined by the limit of the weather radar's range. Similarly, we might say in the hydrology example, where a river gauge measures flow values at regular sampling times, the spatial extent would be the monitoring point where the river gauge is positioned.</p>

      <p>We say that a <a>coverage</a> is really just a special type of <a>Spatial Thing</a> with some particular properties. Often, a coverage can be a property of another <a>Spatial Thing</a>; referring back to hydrology, a "river segment" may have a property “flow rate” that is expressed as a coverage.</p>

      <p><a>Spatial Things</a> and <a>coverages</a> may be related in several ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Signals in coverages may be used to provide the evidence for the existence, location and type of Spatial Things; for example, within a geophysical borehole the variation in soil/rock type may be used to infer the presence of particular rock-units at underground locations.</li>
        <li>As the property value of a Spatial Thing whose value varies within the <a>extent</a> of that Spatial Thing; for example, the varying strength of mobile-network coverage throughout the UK.</li>
        <li>The values of a common property for a distributed set of Spatial Things provide a discrete sampling of a coverage; for example, the measurement of soil moisture based at a set of sampling stations can be compiled to show the spatial variation of soil moisture across the region where the sampling stations are located.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A <a>coverage</a> can be defined using three main pieces of information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <em>domain</em> of the coverage is the set of points in space and time for which we have data values. For example, in a river gauge measurement, the domain is the set of times at which the flow was measured. In a satellite image, the domain is the set of pixels. In a weather forecast, the domain is a set of grid cells.</li>
        <li>The <em>range</em> of the coverage is the set of measured, simulated or observed data values. A single coverage may record values for lots of different quantities; for example, a weather forecast predicts values for many things (temperature, humidity etc.) on the same domain. So the range of a coverage often consists of several lists of data values, one for each measured variable. Each element within each list corresponds with one of the elements of the domain (e.g. a pixel or grid cell).</li>
        <li>The <em>range metadata</em> describes the range of the coverage, to help users to understand what the data values mean. This may include <a>links</a> to definitions of variables, units of measure and other bits of useful information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Usually, the most complex piece of information in the <a>coverage</a> is the definition of the domain. This can vary quite widely from coverage type to coverage type, as the list above shows. For this reason, coverages are often defined by the spatiotemporal <a>geometry</a> of their domain. You will hear people talking about “multidimensional grid coverages” or “time-series coverages” or “vertical profile coverages” for example.</p>

    <section id="spatial-relations">
      <h2>Spatial relations</h2>
      <p>A <a>spatial relation</a> specifies how an object is located in space in relation to a reference
        object. Commonly used types of spatial relations are: topological, directional and distance
        relations.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Topological relations</em> describe the relationships between geometric objects that
          are invariant to rotation, translation and scaling. As such, topological relations can
          support qualitative spatial reasoning without reference to the <a>geometries</a> themselves; for
          example, to assert that object A touches object B. These relations, also known as “spatial
          predicates”, include concepts such as: equals, disjoint, intersects, touches, within,
          contains, overlaps and crosses.</li>
        <li><em>Directional relations</em> specify the relative direction between object and
          reference. Examples include: left, in front of and astern.</li>
        <li><em>Distance relations</em> specify how far the object is from the reference object.
          Examples include: at, nearby and far away.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="CRS-background">
      <h2>Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)</h2>

      <p>One of the most fundamental aspects of publishing <a>spatial data</a>, data about location, is how to express and share the location in a consistent way. In many cases where you are publishing data for use by the wider Web community the use of <a>latitude</a> and <a>longitude</a> coordinates (Lat and Long) is most appropriate. As latitude and longitude coordinates are global they are well suited to many applications: perfect for locating your favorite coffee shop, <a>geocoding</a> a photograph or capturing an augmented reality Pokemon hiding in your local park.</p>

      <p>Users of <a>spatial data</a> are often interested in the third <a>dimension</a> too: vertical elevation (or altitude). For most situations, we can consider elevation to be the vertical distance above (or below) mean sea level. The elevation is most often expressed in meters (but this can vary between <a>CRS</a> definitions) and is provided as a third value in a coordinate position.</p>
      
      <p>As with everything to do with <a>spatial data</a>, things can get more complicated. One of the most common problems occurs because not all <a>Coordinate Reference Systems</a> (CRS) agree how to express <a>latitude</a> and <a>longitude</a> coordinates. Some CRS order the coordinates <em>Lat/Long</em> while others use <em>Long/Lat</em>; some use <em>decimal degrees</em> while others use <em>degrees, minutes and seconds</em> (<em>dms</em>). <a>Axis order</a> mistakes can mean the difference between, say, a position in the Netherlands or somewhere in Somalia, while encoding coordinates in <em>decimal degrees</em> when <em>dms</em> is expected can lead to positional errors on the kilometer scale.  </p>
      
      <p>Therefore, it is very important to provide explicit information to your users about how coordinates are encoded. For example, this snippet of results from the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro">Google Geocoding API</a> makes explicit which is the <a>latitude</a> and which is the <a>longitude</a> coordinate. </p>

      <pre class="example" title="A Google Geocoding API result snippet">
 "formatted_address" : "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA",
         "geometry" : {
            "location" : {
               "lat" : 37.42248,
               "lng" : -122.08425
            },
            "location_type" : "ROOFTOP",
            "viewport" : {
               "northeast" : {
                  "lat" : 37.42382,
                  "lng" : -122.082901
               },
               "southwest" : {
                  "lat" : 37.42113,
                  "lng" : -122.08560
               }
            }
         },
      </pre>
      
      <p>Other mechanisms include using a data format that specifies how the coordinates are included (such as GeoJSON [[RFC7946]] where section <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-4">4. Coordinate Reference System</a> specifies coordinate order of <a>longitude</a> and <a>latitude</a> using units of decimal degrees) or by having your data explicitly reference the <a>CRS</a> definition you're using. See <a href="#bp-crs" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 8: State how coordinate values are encoded</a> for more information.</p>

      <p>Now let's get a little more technical and discuss coordinate reference systems themselves.</p> 
      
      <p><a>Latitude</a>, <a>longitude</a> and elevation measurements express a position on the surface of the Earth. But to define this position we need to state where we are making the measurements from (e.g. the equator, the prime meridian and the approximated surface of the Earth, or <a>geoid</a>) and consider the shape of the earth (a flattened sphere with lumps and bumps, but for convenient mathematical operations, usually approximated to an <a>ellipsoid</a>). This information is used to define the geodetic <a>datum</a> which provides the basis of every <a>coordinate reference system</a>.</p>

      <p>Where your <a>geospatial data</a> has <a>geometries</a> defined as points, lines and polygons (i.e. <em>vector</em> data), publishing in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">World Geodetic System 1984</a> (<strong>WGS 84</strong>) Coordinate Reference System will help people to integrate data with mass-market Web applications, tools and libraries, thereby increasing the usefulness of that data for a large community of potential users. Also, since WGS 84 is also used by the GPS system, it's handy for all those mobile Apps!</p>

      <p>Most people can stop reading now, but of course there are cases where WGS 84 is not appropriate &mdash; for example, when working with geo-referenced imagery.</p>
      
      <p>In many parts of the world location data has been collected using local coordinate systems that are specific to particular countries or regions. These local coordinate systems may use projected measurements defined on a flat, two-dimensional surface (which are easier to use for calculating distances than angular measurements and are essential when making topographic maps).</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>Users of <a>spatial data</a> should be aware that projected coordinate systems distort distances and angular measurements and accordingly affect how <a href="http://thetruesize.com">the true size</a> of countries of countries and other large-scale entities is perceived. CNN explore some of the challenges relating to <a>map projections</a> in their article <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/18/africa/real-size-of-africa/">What's the real size of Africa?</a>.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>So, it may be that you have information in a <a>projected CRS</a>, rather than global <a>latitude</a> and <a>longitude</a> - what should you do? You can publish data as is in one of these many projected CRS, but you need to tell users which particular <a>CRS</a> is being used. A good directory of Coordinate Reference Systems is maintained by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers: the <a href="http://www.epsg.org/">EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset</a>. </p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>It is common for a <a>CRS</a> to be described by its EPSG code. For example, 2-dimensional WGS 84 (Lat/Long) is <a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326">EPSG:4326</a>, 3-dimensional WGS 84 (Lat/Long/Elevation) <a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4979">EPSG:4979</a> and OSGB 1936 / British National Grid (a national projected CRS, based on the OSGB 1936 <a>datum</a>) is <a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::27700">EPSG:27700</a>.</p>
        <p>The authoritative source of <a>CRS</a> definitions is the <a href="http://epsg-registry.org/">EPSG registry</a>. Those definitions are also available from the <a href="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/">Open Geospatial Consortium CRS Register</a>. Other Web services like <a href="http://spatialreference.org/">Spatial Reference</a> and <a href="http://epsg.io/">EPSG.io</a> also provide definitions as used in popular software, but those definitions &mdash; especially the ones published in <a>Well Known Text</a> (WKT) version 1 format &mdash; sometime differ from official EPSG definitions in <a>axis order</a> and units of measurement.</p>
      </div>  
      
      <p>You can re-project your coordinates to WGS 84 using many available tools online. So, for example, the location at <code>516076, 170953</code> in British National Grid (<a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::27700">EPSG:27700</a>) coordinates is <code>-0.331841, 51.425708</code> in WGS 84 Long/Lat. This conversion is a useful step as it makes you data more accessible to global users. So, if you can do so, it is helpful to publish data in both local (projected) and global coordinates.</p>      

      <p>However, given that satellite imagery is comprised of data pixels projected onto a flat surface (i.e. <em>raster</em> data), it is commonplace for raster-type <a>spatial data</a> to be expressed in a <a>projected coordinate reference system</a> to avoid the unnecessary (and potentially costly) conversion of pixel positions to angular measurements. Web-Mercator (<a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::3857">EPSG:3857</a>), a global <a>projected CRS</a>, is used in the majority of Web-mapping applications and has therefore become the de facto Web-standard <a>CRS</a> for publishing raster data.</p>
      
      <p>Re-projecting to a better-known <a>CRS</a> is often a necessary step if you are publishing data in the form of engineering or Computer Aided Design (CAD)  drawings of a new building or road layout for example. Usually these drawings are made using a very local coordinate reference system for the site itself, so the data will need to be reprojected to “fit” with existing data.</p>
      
      <p>So, we are now at the point where almost everyone publishing <a>spatial data</a> on the Web can stop reading. But for those with specific requirements concerning high precision locations, there are a few more topics that need to be mentioned.</p>

      <p>If you need to be able to measure in terms of a few centimeters or less then things are more complicated.  With this level of precision required you need to consider a more sophisticated model of the shape of the Earth and consider plate tectonics.  </p>

      <p>For these more complex use cases other reference systems with alternative geodetic datums are used. The geodetic <a>datum</a> can be thought of as the model of the Earth's surface over which the <a>coordinate reference system</a> is applied. Different datums use different models for the precise <em>shape</em> and <em>size</em> of the Earth to provide more accurate horizontal or vertical measurements at different positions on the globe (because depending on your location, different <a>ellipsoids</a> will provide a better approximation of the local Earth's surface - but this is at the expense of a poorer match elsewhere).</p> 

      <p>While WGS 84 provides a <em>reasonable</em> fit at all points on the Earth's surface, many other datums are defined for improved fit within a regional or national area. For example, in Europe a system called ETRS89 (<a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4258">EPSG:4258</a>) can be used instead of WGS 84, while in North America a similar system called NAD-83 (<a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4269">EPSG:4269</a>) is used.  So, it might be that you have measurements made using these reference systems. Here the best practice is once more to be explicit in describing the <a>CRS</a> used, but also to be careful re-projecting to different systems as required accuracy may be lost.</p>
      
      <p>Finally, another issue is that points on the surface of the earth are actually moving relative to the coordinate system, due to geologic processes. You may think this is of interest only to geologists, but when I tell you that Australia has moved around 1.5m since the framework was last reset 20 years ago, and remind you that we are entering the age of self-driving cars, then you will probably think again. Re-calculating the datum from time to time, or maybe continuously such as in the case of the dynamic New Zealand Geodetic Datum (NZGD2000), really does matter for some applications. See <a href="#bp-crs-choice" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 7: Choose coordinate reference systems to suit your user's applications</a> for more information.</p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>Detailed discussion of <a>coordinate reference system</a> definitions themselves is beyond the scope of this best practice document. Should this topic be of interest, please refer to specialist documentation such as [[OGC-TOPIC-2]] / [[ISO-19111]].</p>

      <h2>Linked Data</h2>
      <p>The term ‘<a>Linked Data</a>’ refers to an approach to publishing data that puts linking at
        the heart of the notion of data, and uses the linking technologies provided by the Web to
        enable the weaving of a global distributed database. By identifying real world entities - be they
        Web resources, physical objects such as the Eiffel Tower, or even more abstract things such
        as relations or concepts - with URLs data can be published and linked in the same way Web
        pages can. [[LDP-PRIMER]]</p>
      <p>The 5-star scheme at <a href="http://5stardata.info">5 Star Data</a> states:</p>
      <p style="text-indent:80px">&#9733; make your stuff available on the Web (whatever format)
        under an open license</p>
      <p style="text-indent:65px">&#9733;&#9733; make it available as structured data (e.g., Excel
        instead of image scan of a table)</p>
      <p style="text-indent:50px">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; make it available in a non-proprietary open
        format (e.g., CSV as well as of Excel)</p>
      <p style="text-indent:35px">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; use URIs to denote things, so that
        people can point at your stuff</p>
      <p style="text-indent:20px">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; link your data to other data
        to provide context</p>
      <p>We think that the concept of <a>Linked Data</a> is fundamental to the publishing of spatial
        data on the Web: it is the <a>links</a> that connect data together that are the foundational
        to the Web of data.</p>
      <p>These best practices promote a Linked Data approach.</p>
      <p>Sources such as the Best Practices for Publishing Linked Data [[LD-BP]] assert a strong
        association between <a>Linked Data</a> and the <a>Resource Description Framework</a> (RDF)
        [[RDF11-PRIMER]]. Yet we believe that Linked Data requires only that the formats used to
        publish data support Web linking (see [[WEBARCH]] <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#hypertext">section 4.4 Hypertext</a>). <a href="http://5stardata.info">5 Star Data</a> (based on [[5STAR-LOD]])
        asserts only that data formats be open and non-proprietary (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;); and
        infers the need for data formats to support use of URIs as identifiers
        (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;) and Web linking (&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;).</p>
      <p>In fact, our approach to <a>linked data</a> is well described by an alternative 5-star scheme from [[WEB-DATA]]:</p>
      <p style="text-indent:80px"><span style="color:grey">&#9733; <strong>Linkable</strong></span>: use stable and discoverable global identifiers</p>
      <p style="text-indent:65px"><span style="color:grey">&#9733;&#9733; <strong>Parseable</strong></span>: use standardized data metamodels such as <a>CSV</a> [[RFC4180]], <a>XML</a> [[XML11]], <a>RDF</a> [[RDF11-PRIMER]], or <a>JSON</a> [[RFC7159]].</p>

      <p>Within this document, we include examples that use <a>RDF</a> and related technologies such
        as <a>triple stores</a> and <a>SPARQL</a> [[SPARQL11-OVERVIEW]]
        because we see evidence of its use in real world
        applications that support <a>Linked Data</a>. However, we must make clear to readers that
        there is no requirement for all publishers of <a>spatial data</a> on the Web to embrace the wider
        suite of technologies associated with the <a>Semantic Web</a>; we recognize that in many cases, a
        Web developer has little or no interest in the toolchains associated with Semantic Web due
        to its addition of complexity to any Web-centric solution.</p>
      <p>Although we think that <a>Linked Data</a> need not necessarily require the use of
          <a>RDF</a>, it is probably the most common representation. We note that [[JSON-LD]] provides a bridge
        between those worlds by providing a data format that is compatible with RDF but relies on
        standard <a>JSON</a> tooling.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, as the examples in this document illustrate, we often see a ‘hybrid’ approach
        being used in real-world applications; using <a>RDF</a> to work with graphs of information
        that interlink resources, while relying for performance reasons on other technologies to query and process the
        spatial aspects of that information.</p>

          Part of this are domain-specific complexities that are difficult for non-experts (e.g.,
          handling of coordinates in different <a>coordinate reference systems</a>), but hard to avoid
          entirely. But the datasets often address requirements of expert communities with diverse
          needs, resulting in comprehensive, but complex specifications that cover many edge cases,
          too. And the data is typically available in formats that are not easy to process for
          non-expert users.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, <a>spatial data infrastructures</a> are a key component of the broader <a>spatial data</a> ecosystem. Such infrastructures typically include policies, workflows and tools related to the management and curation of spatial datasets, and provide mechanism to support the rich set of capabilities required by the expert community. Our goal is to help spatial data publishers build on these foundations to enable the spatial data from <a>SDIs</a> to be fully integrated with the Web of data.</p>
      <p>When your starting point is a <a>spatial data infrastructure</a>, you should at least read the following best practices. These provide the most important extra steps that should be taken to bring <a>spatial data</a> from <a>spatial data infrastructures</a> to the Web: </p>

      <h2>The Best Practices</h2>
      <section id="bp-webprinciples">
        <h3>Web principles for spatial data</h3>
        <p><a>Spatial data</a>, like any other data, should be published on the Web. By this we mean more than providing spatial data file downloads or services; for data to be <em>on the Web</em>, the resources it describes need to be identified using HTTP URIs, be published in such a way that they are indexable by search engines, and be connected, or linked, to other resources. This makes the data easy to find and easy to access for non-specialist users: the spatial data becomes integrated within the wider Web of data. </p>
        <section id="bp-identifiers">
          <h4>Spatial data identifiers</h4>
          <p>As a first step in publishing your <a>spatial data</a> on the Web, you should assign a URI to each of your datasets (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#UniqueIdentifiers">Best Practice 9: Use persistent URIs as identifiers of datasets</a>).</p>

          <div class="note">
            <p>Deciding whether your <a>spatial data</a> is a single dataset or not is somewhat arbitrary. To decide this, it is often useful to consider attributes such as the license under which the data will be made available, the refresh or publication schedules, the quality of the data and the governance regime applied in managing the data. Typically, all of these attributes should be consistent within a single dataset.</p>
            <p>[[VOCAB-DCAT]] provides a useful definition of dataset that supports this approach: “A collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more formats.”</p>
          </div>

          <p>However, we need to look inside the datasets at the resources described within your data. If you want these resources to be visible within the Web’s information space, by which we mean that others can refer to or talk about those resources, then they must also be assigned URIs (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#identifiersWithinDatasets">Best Practice 10: Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets</a>). These URIs are like 'Web-scale foreign keys' that enable information from different sources to be stitched together.</p>

          <p>The primary topics of any spatial dataset are <a>Spatial Things</a> &mdash; anything from physical things like people, places and post boxes to abstractions such as administrative areas. Each <a>Spatial Thing</a> will be described by a set of attributes and usually at least one <a>geometry</a>. How your <a>spatial data</a> is structured will depend on the vocabulary or data model you use (see <a href="#bp-expressing-spatial" class="sectionRef"></a> for further details on vocabulary choice). This will determine the types of entities that, along with the <a>Spatial Things</a> themselves, are important enough to be given identifiers so that statements can be made about them. Geometry objects are an example of an entity that is often assigned a unique identifier so that they can be referenced or reused.</p>
          
          <p>Given the widespread use of the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) on the Web, we SHOULD use HTTP URIs to identify resources in <a>spatial data</a>.</p>
          
          <p>This is a fundamentally different approach to that of typical data publication today &mdash; where the dataset is (often) globally identified, but individual <a>Spatial Things</a> ( "<a>features</a>" in <a>SDI</a> parlance), are assigned local identifiers which may, or may not, be persistent.</p>
          
          <div class="note">
            <p>We consider identifiers in the Web’s information space to be unaffected by the choice to serve HTTP content securely or not. For example, <code>http://example.org/country/suriname</code> and <code>https://example.org/country/suriname</code> both identify the same <a>Spatial Thing</a> - in this case the South American country of Suriname.</p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
            <p>To publish <a>spatial data</a> on the Web, we need to stitch the <a>Spatial Things</a> and their corresponding entities into the Web’s information space; contributing to the <em>Web of data</em>. First: [[WEBARCH]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#p38">Good Practice: Identify with URIs</a> states that "agents should provide URIs as identifiers for resources". Second: the <a href="http://5stardata.info">5 Star Data scheme</a> states: "&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; use URIs to denote things, so that people can point at your stuff".</p>

            <p>Resources identified with HTTP URIs can be specified as the target of <a>links</a> within the Web’s global information space, enabling information to be related, combined and referred to. This is the fundamental basis of 5&#9733; Linked Data: "&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; link your data to other data to provide context".</p>
            
            <p>The HTTP URIs used to identify <a>Spatial Things</a> need to be stable or persistent so that relationships that link them to other resources don’t break.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="outcome">
            <h4 class="subhead">Intended Outcome</h4>
            <p>Spatial Things become part of the Web’s global information space enabling them be linked with other <a>Spatial Things</a> and other resources and for those <a>links</a> to be durable. In other words, <a>spatial data</a> becomes part of the Web of Data.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
            <p>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#identifiersWithinDatasets">Best Practice 10: Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets</a> provides directly applicable guidance when identifying resources. It advises:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Seek and reuse existing URIs, ensuring that the URIs are persistent and they are published by a trusted group or organization; or</li>
              <li>Create your own persistent URIs.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>However, we need to look a little more closely at how and where to apply that guidance.</p>

            <p>The Web of data is made up of <em>subjects</em> and <em>objects</em>; the things we talk about and the things we refer to. For example, we could say that <strong>Anne Frank's House</strong> (the <em>subject</em>) is within <strong>the Municipality of Amsterdam</strong> (the <em>object</em>). In <a>RDF</a> [[RDF11-PRIMER]], this looks like:</p>
            
            <p><code>&lt;</code><a href="https://g.co/kg/m/02s5hd"><code>https://g.co/kg/m/02s5hd</code></a><code>&gt;</code> <a href="http://schema.org/containedInPlace"><code>schema:containedInPlace</code></a> <code>&lt;</code><a href="http://sws.geonames.org/2759793/"><code>http://sws.geonames.org/2759793/</code></a><code>&gt;</code> <code>.</code></p>
            
            <p>When considering HTTP URIs for <em>objects</em> (e.g. the target of our hyperlinks) it makes sense to reuse existing identifiers. After all, you <em>are</em> trying to stitch your <a>spatial data</a> into the Web so that we can "link your data to other data" and achieve a &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; rating! Organizations such as <a href="http://dbpedia.org">DBPedia</a>, <a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a> and government mapping and cadastral authorities (that publish national registers of addresses, buildings, etc.) are good sources of stable, authoritative URIs. The steps described for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ld-bp/#how-to-find-existing-vocabularies">discovering existing vocabularies</a> [[LD-BP]] can be readily adapted to find more. For more details about how you might link to these authoritative identifiers, see <a href="#bp-linking" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>
            
            <p>However, HTTP URIs for <em>subjects</em> (e.g. the resource that we want to make statements about) can be trickier. If you are working purely with data then you can reuse existing URIs minted by other authorities for your <em>subject</em> URIs. But publishing <a>spatial data</a> on the Web means that the URIs for each <a>Spatial Thing</a> should dereference to Web pages or data resources that provide useful information (see <a href="#indexable-by-search-engines" class="sectionRef"></a>). An HTTP request will be directed to a host Web server, identified by the internet domain name (or IP address) in the requested URI. If you use a URI with an internet domain name where you have no control over how the Web server behaves, then there is no way for your statements to be included in the Web server's response.</p>
            
            <p>To take control of how information about <a>Spatial Things</a> is presented, data publishers need to assign their subject Spatial Things HTTP URIs from an internet domain name where they have authority over how the Web server responds. Typically, this means minting new HTTP URIs. It's all worth considering that the use of a particular internet domain may reinforce the authority of the information served. For example, a URI for Anne Frank's House is: <a href="https://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/monuments?MonumentId=4296"><code>https://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/monuments?MonumentId=4296</code></a>. The use of the internet domain registered to the <a href="https://cultureelerfgoed.nl/">Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands</a> gives the definition authenticity.</p>
            
            <div class="note">
              <p>The need to control what information is provided about a given <a>Spatial Thing</a> means that it is not uncommon for a Spatial Thing to be identified by multiple HTTP URIs. The equality between two URIs that refer to the same resource can be stated using a property such as <code>owl:sameAs</code>. Care must always be taken when using <code>owl:sameAs</code> to determine that the two URIs actually refer to the same resource, rather than two resources that are similar. Warning: don't say it if you're not sure it's true!</p>
              <p>For more information about the types of properties that can be used to link between <a>Spatial Things</a>, and between Spatial Things and other resources, see <a href="#bp-linking" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>When minting your own URIs, [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#identifiersWithinDatasets">Best Practice 10: Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets</a> cites the advice from GS1's SmartSearch Implementation Guideline [[GS1]] which suggests that your URIs should include the type of resource that is being identified to help human readability. Also, given the need for the HTTP URIs for <a>Spatial Things</a> to be used throughout their lifetime (and perhaps beyond) you should give some thought to designing a URI that is persistent.</p> 
            <aside class="example" id="ex-amsterdam-station-uri">
              <p>This URI identifies the Amsterdam Central train station: </p>
              <p><code>https://brt.basisregistraties.overheid.nl/top10nl/id/gebouw/102625209</code></p>
              <p>This URI was minted using the recommendations in the Dutch URI strategy. Although minted by the Kadaster, they chose to use the domain ‘basisregistraties.overheid.nl’ (which translates to ‘base registries . government . nl’) because this is expected to be a more persistent name than ‘kadaster.nl’. Even though the Kadaster is over a 100-years old, organization names are not considered persistent in general as organizations may merge or their names may change. ‘top10nl’ is the name of the dataset, and ‘gebouw’ means ‘building’ – giving the human reader of this URI a clue of what is being identified. The last part of the URI is the building number from the dataset.</p>
            </aside>
            
            <p>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#UniqueIdentifiers">Best Practice 9: Use persistent URIs as identifiers of datasets</a> cites the European Commission's Study on Persistent URIs [[PURI]] as a good source from which to gain insights about designing persistent URIs.</p>
            
            <p>When an HTTP URI is dereferenced, the server will respond with a sequence of bytes: by its nature, HTTP can only serve <em>information resources</em> such as Web pages or <a>JSON</a> [[RFC7159]] documents. Yet a <a>Spatial Thing</a> is actually a real or conceptual phenomenon - a lake is made from water not information! Using a single URI to refer to <em>both</em> the Spatial Thing and the page/document that describes the Spatial Thing introduces a URI collision. This can impose a cost in communication due to the effort required to resolve ambiguities. [[URLs-in-data]] has more to say on this subject, including recommending URI design patterns that enable differentiation between the Spatial Thing and the page/document that describes it.</p> 
            
            <p>However, in most cases using a single URI for both <a>Spatial Thing</a> and the page/document is simpler to implement and meets the expectations of most end-users. As stated in [[WEBARCH]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-webarch-20041215/#indirect-identification">section 2.2.3 Indirect Identification</a>, identifiers are commonly used in this way. There is no obligation to distinguish between the Spatial Thing and the page/document unless your application requires this.</p> 
            
            <div class="note">
              <p>While there is a cost to this conflation, problems can be mitigated by avoiding making statements that confuse <a>Spatial Thing</a> and the page/document, such as “Uluru is available in KML format”; e.g. <code>&lt;</code><a href="http://sws.geonames.org/7645281/"><code>http://sws.geonames.org/7645281/</code></a><code>&gt; dcterms:hasFormat &lt;</code><a href="http://www.geonames.org/kml/-25.34434_131.03282_15.kml"><code>http://www.geonames.org/kml/-25.34434_131.03282_15.kml</code></a><code>&gt; .</code></p>
              <p>This statement is clearly not true; an ancient monolith covering more than 3 km<sup>2</sup> cannot be provided in <a>XML</a> [[XML11]]!</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>HTTP URIs for <a>Spatial Things</a> should not include any indication of the data format used to encode the page/document as this may change as your systems evolve. That said, you may wish to provide a set of complementary resources that specify a particular format as part of your content negotiation strategy. For example, the URI <a href="http://sws.geonames.org/7645281/about.rdf"><code>http://sws.geonames.org/7645281/about.rdf</code></a> dereferences to provide an RDF/XML encoding of the information about Uluru in the Northern Territory of Australia (<a href="http://sws.geonames.org/7645281/"><code>http://sws.geonames.org/7645281/</code></a>).</p>
            
            <p>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#identifiersWithinDatasets">Best Practice 10: Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets</a> notes that URIs can be long. You may need to define identifiers that are locally unique within your spatial dataset and provide a mechanism to programmatically convert each local identifier to a URI. For example, the Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data [[TABULAR-METADATA]] achieves this using URI Templates as described in [[RFC6570]].</p>
            
            <p>It is also good practice to use a redirection service to hide complex and potentially changing service end-point URLs, such as for a <a>Web Feature Service</a> [[WFS]] behind well-designed URIs. This means that users don’t need to be aware of the complexities of the API or changes in endpoint URIs or API versions to request information about a particular <a>Spatial Thing</a>. For example, the URI <code>http://data.example.org/aan/id/perceel/aan.2528</code> could be used as proxy for the WFS GetFeature request <a href="http://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/aan/wfs?VERSION=2.0.0&amp;SERVICE=WFS&amp;REQUEST=GetFeature&amp;RESOURCEID=aan.2528"><code>http://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/aan/wfs?VERSION=2.0.0&amp;SERVICE=WFS&amp;REQUEST=GetFeature&amp;RESOURCEID=aan.2528</code></a>.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, while it is simple to use a query-pattern URL to serve information about a resource identified with a URI from a third-party internet domain, e.g. <code>http://example.org/museums?q=http://sws.geonames.org/6618987/</code>, these URLs are unsuitable as persistent identifiers. More often than not, your intended users will dereference the "official" URI, e.g. <code>http://sws.geonames.org/6618987/</code>. That said, this kind of search operation does provide a useful mechanism to find particular <a>Spatial Things</a>. See <a href="#convenience-apis" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 12: Expose spatial data through 'convenience APIs'</a> for further details.</p>

            <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
            
            <p>In <a>SDIs</a> information about spatial datasets is published as authoritative metadata records and collated in Web-based catalogues. This approach causes several problems:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>the catalogues are often designed to primarily support expert users - people may not even be aware of their existence;</li>
              <li>once you have discovered a dataset that meets your needs and identified where it is available from, a second step is required to access the data itself - often requiring the use of unfamiliar protocols or complex API requests; and</li>
              <li>the data itself is not indexed - discovery relies on the metadata records that are often sparsely populated or out of date.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Search engines are the common starting point for people looking for content on the Web that is widely understood. By publishing <a>spatial data</a> in a way that enables their crawlers to index spatial datasets including each <a>Spatial Thing</a>, the fidelity of search results should improve. Users will be able to directly search for specific entities rather than having to look for a dataset and then parse through it; e.g. to search for "Anne Frank’s House" (<a href="https://g.co/kg/m/02s5hd"><code>https://g.co/kg/m/02s5hd</code></a>) rather than looking for a dataset about "Cultural Heritage in Amsterdam" and hoping that it contains a reference to what you’re interested in.</p>
            
            <p class="note">At present, spatial information is not widely exploited by search engines. However, by increasing the volume of spatial information presented to search engines, and the consistency with which it is provided, we expect search engines to begin offering spatial search functions. We already see evidence of this in the form of contextual search, such as prioritization of search results from nearby entities. In addition, search engines are beginning to offer more structured, custom searches that return only results that include certain [[SCHEMA-ORG]] types, like <a href="http://schema.org/Dataset">Dataset</a>, <a href="http://schema.org/Place">Place</a> or <a href="http://schema.org/City">City</a>.</p>

When metadata for datasets has already been created, e.g. to create a record in a metadata catalogue or to describe the data available from a service end-point, this information should be re-used - publishing it in a Web-friendly way that humans and Web-crawlers can consume. The landing page should be indexable by the search engines so that it can be discovered too!</p>
            
            <p>To enable humans and Web-crawlers to find HTML pages for the <a>Spatial Things</a>, the "landing page" needs to include hyperlinks that can be followed. Where you have a larger collection of Spatial Things, you should support paging through the collection.</p> 
            
            <p>You may also consider using <a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html">Sitemaps</a> to direct the Web-crawler. For larger datasets, multiple sitemaps can be provided and grouped by a sitemap index file. If a dataset contains millions of <a>Spatial Things</a> (e.g. a building dataset with national coverage), generating and maintaining the sitemaps may require a custom implementation to keep the sitemaps with the set of Spatial Things synchronized.</p>				
            
            <p>For very large datasets paging through thousands of pages is not useful for a human either. Consider supporting filtering and/or organize the <a>Spatial Things</a> into subsets, as described in <a href="#bp-exposing-via-api" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>
            
            <aside class="example">
              <p>In case of an address dataset, you could organize the <a>Spatial Things</a> (the addresses) by municipality, post code and street name to support a human user to get to a building with a few clicks.</p>
            </aside>
            
            <p>A pre-condition for this best practice is <a href="#globally-unique-ids">Best Practice 1: Use globally unique persistent HTTP URIs for Spatial Things</a> as persistent identifiers are essential to support reliable indexing and linking. Traditionally spatial datasets have not been maintained with stable identifiers for <a>Spatial Things</a>, but to share <a>spatial data</a> on the Web stable identifiers are a must. Sharing spatial data is more than "just" making the dataset available on the Web.</p>
            
            <p>Each Web-page, and the hyperlinks used to relate the <a>Spatial Things</a> to the dataset landing page, can likely be generated programmatically from the data you hold about the Spatial Thing, either directly from the data or by using an API that makes the data available on the Web.</p>
            
            <aside class="example">
              <p>Possible implementation approaches for addressing this best practice in the context of an existing <a>SDI</a> are discussed in more detail in <a href="#convenience-apis">Best Practice 12: Expose spatial data through 'convenience APIs'</a> for additional information. For example, by using a proxy tool like <a href="https://github.com/interactive-instruments/ldproxy">ldproxy</a> or by mapping the data in the SDI dynamically to crawlable resources on the Web using the [[R2RML]] standard and Linked Data Publication tools. Both approaches generate crawlable data from <a>Spatial Things</a> in your spatial datasets at query time and allow to enrich the data on the Web with additional information and <a>links</a>.</p>
            </aside>
            
            <p>It is important to keep in mind that the HTML representations should not mainly be designed for the search engines, but they should present the data in a clear and understandable way to human users. The page about the <a>Spatial Thing</a> should be useful to a user and encourage others to link to the page when they share other information about the Spatial Thing. This typically will also improve the ranking of these pages in search results.</p>
            
            <aside class="example">
              <p>The <a href="http://maps.nanaimo.ca/data/property/">Property Search in the City of Nanaimo, Canada</a> provides a landing page and one page per property. The landing page offers a search capability and the option to browse by street. This data is indexed; a search for, for example, "2100 AARON WAY, NANAIMO, BC" in a popular search engine returns the Nanaimo data for this <a>Spatial Thing</a> as one of the first results.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://environment.data.gov.uk/bwq/profiles/">Bathing Water Quality Explorer for England</a> provides a landing page and one page per site. Sites can be searched, selected from a list or in a map.</p>
              <p>In both cases, the pages of the <a>Spatial Things</a> are generated from the underlying data at request time.</p>
              <p>The property Web-pages in Nanaimo also use [[MICRODATA]] annotations using [[SCHEMA-ORG]], which is discussed below.</p>
            </aside>
            
            <p>In addition to exposing the <a>spatial data</a> as linked HTML Web-pages, indexing by Web-engines can be further enhanced by incorporating a description of the <a>Spatial Thing</a> as structured markup (in particular [[MICRODATA]] or [[JSON-LD]] annotations using [[SCHEMA-ORG]]) as this enables the search engines to make more detailed assumptions about your resource. It is important to note that this is not only helpful to search engines, but also to other tools that want to understand more about the semantics of the resource, for example, its location.</p>
            
            <p>In [[SCHEMA-ORG]], a spatial dataset is a <a href="http://schema.org/Dataset">Dataset</a> and a <a>Spatial Thing</a> is in general a <a href="http://schema.org/Place">Place</a> or an <a href="http://schema.org/Event">Event</a>. For some types of Spatial Things, more specific sub-types exist, for example <a href="http://schema.org/City">City</a> or <a href="http://schema.org/Mountain">Mountain</a>.</p> 
            
            <p>Location information about a <a>Spatial Thing</a> is typically provided using a <a>geometry</a> (<a href="http://schema.org/GeoCoordinates">GeoCoordinates</a> or <a href="http://schema.org/GeoShape">GeoShape</a>) or a <a href="http://schema.org/PostalAddress">PostalAddress</a>. [[SCHEMA-ORG]] coordinates are restricted to WGS 84 with <a>longitude</a> and <a>latitude</a>. Supported geometry types are points, line strings, polygons, boxes and circles.</p>
            
            <p>By using [[SCHEMA-ORG]] annotations, search engines and others can connect location information with other information, e.g. about the nature of the <a>Spatial Thing</a>, opening hours, contact details, etc.</p>
            
            <p>The use of [[SCHEMA-ORG]] for <a>spatial data</a> is in its early days and should be understood as an "emerging practice".</p>

            <p>Typically, multiple formats for a resource are supported using two mechanisms: HTTP content negotiation and by adding format-specific file extensions to the resource URI like "<code>.json</code>", "<code>.xml</code>" or "<code>.ttl</code>".

          <h4>Linking data</h4>
          
          <p><a>Links</a>, in whatever machine-readable form, are important. In the wider Web, it is links that enable the discovery of Web pages: from user-agents following a hyperlink to find related information to search engines using links to prioritize and refine search results. This section is concerned with the creation and use of those links to support discovery of the <a>SpatialThings</a> described in spatial datasets.</p>
          
          <p>For data to be <em>on the Web</em>, the resources it describes need to be connected, or <em>linked</em>, to other resources. The <em>connectedness</em> of data is one of the fundamentals of the <a>Linked Data</a> approach that these best practices build upon.</p> 
          
          <p>Just like any type of data, <a>spatial data</a> benefits massively from linking when publishing on the Web. The widespread use of <a>links</a> within data is regarded as one of the most significant departures from contemporary practices used within <a>SDIs</a>. That's why this topic is included in this Best Practice.</p>
          
          <p>[[DWBP]] identifies <em>Linkability</em> as one of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#BP_Benefits">benefits</a> gained from implementing the Data on the Web best practices (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#DataIdentifiers">section 8.7 Data Identifiers</a> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#UniqueIdentifiers">Best Practice 9: Use persistent URIs as identifiers of datasets</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#identifiersWithinDatasets">Best Practice 10: Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets</a>). However, no discussion is provided about how to create <a>links</a> that can make use of those persistent URIs. This section of the document extends [[DWBP]] by providing a best practice about <em>creating</em> links between the resources described inside spatial datasets.</p>
          
          <div class="note">
            <p>Discussion of <a>links</a> in these best practices are limited to simple links that relate exactly two resources: the <em>source</em> and <em>target</em>. Complex links that relate an arbitrary number of resources, such as described in [[XLINK11]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xlink11/#extended-link">section 5.1 Extended Links</a>, are out of scope.</p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
            <p>The <a href="http://5stardata.info">5&#9733; rating for Linked Open Data</a> asserts that to achieve the fifth star you must "link your data to other data to provide context". The benefits for consumers and publishers of linking to other data are <a href="http://5stardata.info/en/#addendum5">listed</a> as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You can discover more (related) data while consuming the data.</li>
              <li>You can directly learn about the data schema.</li>
              <li>You make your data discoverable.</li>
              <li>You increase the value of your data.</li>
              <li>Your own organization will gain the same benefits from the <a>links</a> as the [other] consumers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is always a cost to traversal of a <a>link</a>, even if it is just a few milliseconds delay and the need to parse a few hundred or thousand bytes returned in response to an HTTP request. In many cases, such as when dealing with large datasets and complex queries, the costs incurred from traversing a link may be significant in terms of time and data volumes. Before a user or software agent decides to traverse a link, they should be able to determine whether acquisition of the target resource, or data <em>about</em> the target resource, will support their application goals. For example, what format can one expect the response in, what type of resource is the target and how is that target related to the source resource?</p>

            <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
            <p>The ground-rules for linking <a>spatial data</a> are the same as for <em>any</em> type of data.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Use formats that support Web linking (as defined in [[WEBARCH]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#hypertext">section 4.4 Hypertext</a>)</p>
                <p>Earlier in this document (<a href="#linked-data" class="sectionRef"></a>) we explained that <a>linked data</a> requires only that the formats used to publish data support Web linking. In other words, linking <a>spatial data</a> does not automatically mean the use of <a>RDF</a> [[RDF11-PRIMER]]; <a>links</a> can also be created, for example, using [[GML]], HTML or [[JSON-LD]]. The two key points from [[WEBARCH]] are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong><em>Good practice: Link identification</em></strong> &mdash; A [data format] specification SHOULD provide ways to identify <a>links</a> to other resources [...].</li>
                  <li><strong><em>Good practice: Web linking</em></strong> &mdash; A [data format] specification SHOULD allow Web-wide linking, not just internal document linking.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The examples used in this best practice illustrate some of the data formats and mechanisms that support Web linking.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Follow the principles for <strong>4&#9733; &mdash; Linked</strong> [[WEB-DATA]]</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Always use global identifiers when linking between documents, so that <a>link</a> identifiers can be taken out of context and shared globally.</p>
                    <div class="note">
                      <p><strong>4&#9733;</strong> [[WEB-DATA]] is predicated on the use of global identifiers for resources. As such, we consider <a href="#globally-unique-ids" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 1: Use globally unique persistent HTTP URIs for Spatial Things</a> as a prerequisite for linking.</p>
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><a>Links</a> should be typed (explicitly or implicitly), so that clients can decide which link to follow when they are traversing a Web of interlinked resources to reach application goals.</p>
                    <pre class="example" id="ex-webdata2-typed-links" title="HTTP response Link header with IANA Link Relation types">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{...}
                    </pre>
                    <p>This example, using HTTP Link headers (as defined in [[RFC5988]]), illustrates the use of IANA [[LINK-RELATION-TYPES]] to define the <a>link</a> type. According to the IANA registry, <code>predecessor-version</code> <em>points to a resource containing the predecessor version in the version history</em> (as defined in [[RFC5829]] "Link Relation Types for Simple Version Navigation between Web Resources").</p>
                    <div class="note">
                      <p>In simple <a>links</a> involving only two resources, the <em>role</em>, or type, of each resource are implicit and can be inferred from the link relation type. It can be useful to include other information to help users judge whether to follow a link such as human-readable labels and hints about the target resource type. Of course, often target resources and the links that refer to them are maintained by different parties, so such hints should be assumed as prescriptive; they may or may not turn out to be true. For example, [[RFC5988]] "Web Linking" defines several additional attributes including: <code>hreflang</code> &mdash; hints at the language or languages that the target resource is available in; <code>type</code> &mdash; indicates the media-type expected; and <code>title</code> &mdash; labels the link target such that it can be used as a human-readable identifier etc.</p>
                      <p>Also note that [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#Conneg">Best Practice 19: Use content negotiation for serving data available in multiple formats</a> recommends the use of <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Conneg">content negotiation</a> to help ensure that a user or software agent is provided with useful content when they traverse a <a>link</a> and dereference to the target resource. However, HTTP Request headers are limited to specifying media-type, character set, encoding (e.g. for compression) and language. There is no mechanism to request that data is provided according to a particular data model or 'profile', nor request data in a particular <a>coordinate reference system</a>. This gap in current practice is discussed in <a href="#c-geometrycrs" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>

        <h3>Spatial data</h3>
        <p>The best practices in this section take [[DWBP]] as a basis and further refine them to provide more specific guidance for <a>spatial data</a>.</p>
        <section id="bp-expressing-spatial">
          <h4>Spatial data encoding</h4>
          <p>This section does not elaborate on formats for publishing <a>spatial data</a> on the Web. The formats are basically the same as for publishing any other data on the Web: <a>XML</a> [[XML11]], <a>JSON</a> [[RFC7159]], <a>CSV</a> [[RFC4180]], <a>RDF</a> [[RDF11-PRIMER]], etc. Refer to [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#dataFormats">section 8.6 Data Formats</a> for more information and best practices. Refer to <a href="#applicability-formatVbp" class="sectionRef">Appendix A. Applicability of common formats to implementation of best practices</a> for a list of spatial data formats for the Web.</p>
          <p>That being said, it is important to publish your <a>spatial data</a> with clear semantics, i.e. to provide information about the contents of your data. The primary use case
            for this is you have information about a collection of <a>Spatial Things</a> and you want to
            publish precise information about their attributes and how they are inter-related. Another
            use case is the publication on the Web of a dataset that has a spatial component in a form
            that search engines will understand. </p>
          <p>Depending on the format you use, the semantics may already be described in some form. For example, in GeoJSON [[RFC7946]] this description is present in the specification. When using <a>JSON</a> it is possible to add semantics using a [[JSON-LD]] <code>@context</code> object. For providing semantics to search engines, using [[SCHEMA-ORG]] is a good option, as explained in <a href="#indexable-by-search-engines" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 2: Make your spatial data indexable by search engines</a>. In a <a>linked data</a> setting, the attributes of a <a>Spatial Thing</a> can be described using existing vocabularies, where
            each term has a published definition. If you can't find a suitable existing vocabulary term, you should create
            your own, and publish a clear definition for the new term, linking it to commonly used existing ones if possible, 
            because this increases its usefulness. An overview and high-level comparison of <a>RDF</a> vocabularies / OWL ontologies for <a>spatial data</a> is provided in <a href="#applicability-formatVbp" class="sectionRef"></a>. We do not recommend one vocabulary because this recommendation would not remain durable as vocabularies are released or amended.</p>
          <p>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#dataVocabularies">section 8.9 Data Vocabularies</a> provides guidance on the topic of data modelling; determining which concepts and relationships should be used to describe your area of interest, something usually done by <em>domain experts</em>. Data publishers should not attempt to guess <em>all</em> the purposes for which someone might use or reference their data - ending up with a super-complex data model that tries to cover every possible use case. Instead, data publishers should try to help data consumers make informed decisions about the best way to use the data by providing good metadata.</p>
          <p>In most cases, the effective use of information resources requires understanding thematic concepts in addition to the spatial ones; "spatial" is just a facet of the
              broader information space. For example, when the <a href="http://www.brandweer.nl/amsterdam-amstelland">Dutch Fire Service</a> responded to an incident at a day care center, they needed to evacuate the children. In this case, the <em>2nd</em> closest alternative day care center was preferred because it was operated by the same organization as the one that was subject of the incident, and they knew who all the children were.</p>
            
            <p>This best practice document provides mechanisms for determining how places and locations are related - but determining the compatibility or validity of thematic data elements is beyond our scope; we're not attempting to solve the problem of different views on the same/similar resources.</p>
            
          <p>That said, there is one aspect of thematic semantics that must be mentioned. The most important semantic statement you can make when publishing <a>spatial data</a> - or any data - is to specify the <em>type</em> of a resource. For <a>Spatial Things</a>, there are several types that define "spatialness" (for examples in a <a>linked data</a> context, see <a href="#table-vocabs-matrix">the vocabularies table </a> in Appendix A of this document). But you should also consider non-spatial aspects when designating the type of a <a>Spatial Thing</a>. For example, should a fire incident occur at Amsterdam Central railway station, it might seem sensible for the Municipal Fire Department to designate a type such as <strong>Building</strong> or <strong>Station</strong> (the Dutch Government Base Registry defines Amsterdam Central railway station, identified as <a href="https://brt.basisregistraties.overheid.nl/top10nl/id/gebouw/102625209"><code>https://brt.basisregistraties.overheid.nl/top10nl/id/gebouw/102625209</code></a>, designates both of these types). However, the Fire Departments are concerned with a <em>fire incident</em> - not the railway station itself. The fire incident is a <a>Spatial Thing</a> (it has spatial <a>extent</a>) but it is <em>not</em> the station. For example, the fire may spread to adjacent buildings. The Fire Department might designate their <a>Spatial Thing</a> as having type <strong>FireIncident</strong> or similar. Advice on how to assign a persistent identifier to the fire incident is provided in <a href="#globally-unique-ids" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 1: Use globally unique persistent HTTP URIs for Spatial Things</a>, and <a href="#bp-linking" class="sectionRef"></a> provides guidance on how one might relate the fire incident to other coincident Spatial Things such as Amsterdam Central railway station.</p>

              <p><a>Spatial data</a> can be used easily and reliably by the target users.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="how">
              <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
              <p>A high-level objective of these best practices is to highlight approaches that data publishers can take to maximize the ease of use of their <a>spatial data</a> via the Web and hence present data in a way that meets the needs of as wide a range of users and applications as possible.</p>
              <p>One way of classifying the applications of spatial data is as follows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Web pages for people to read about <a>Spatial Things</a></li>
                <li>Web mapping or visualization applications</li>
                <li>Data integration - combining spatial data with other data</li>
                <li>Spatial analytics - discover meaningful patterns in spatial data</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Each of these has different needs: often it will be possible or desirable to support several of these application groups.</p>
              <p>The main objective is to encode data in a way that recipients can easily decode and understand. To decide this, you need to consider which purpose(s) and which audience(s) are you aiming to serve and the characteristics of the data that you want to share.  For example:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>the volume of data</li>
                <li>how many spatial <a>dimensions</a> it covers (points, lines, areas, 3D)</li>
                <li>what kind of area it covers (one building, a town, a whole country)</li>
                <li>how frequently it changes</li>
                <li>the level of spatial precision that exists in the data and the precision needed by users</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h5>1. Web pages for people to read about Spatial Things</h5>
              <p>In <a href="#globally-unique-ids" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 1</a> we recommend use of HTTP URIs as a way of assigning identifiers to <a>Spatial Things</a>. The data publisher should offer the ability to look up ('dereference') such a URI to find out useful information about that <a>Spatial Thing</a> in human readable form (as well as machine readable formats - see the discussion below on data integration).  Each <a>Spatial Thing</a> therefore gets its own Web page - in addition it might be useful to have Web pages about groups of <a>Spatial Things</a>, but the 'page per thing' approach enables fine-grained linking of information.</p>
              <p>To promote discovery of such Web pages in search engines, each page should contain a clear text description of what it is, ideally in a way that distinguishes it from pages about other similar <a>Spatial Things</a>. Including metadata using the [[SCHEMA-ORG]] vocabulary, embedded as [[MICRODATA]], [[HTML-RDFa]] or as [[JSON-LD]] in the <em>&lt;head&gt;</em> section of the page can provide additional information to search engines to support more precise indexing.  See <a href="#indexable-by-search-engines" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 2: Making data indexable by search engines</a> for a more detailed discussion.</p>
              <p>It is also very useful in such Web pages to include <a>links</a> to descriptions of the <a>Spatial Thing</a> in other formats (typically machine-readable formats) as well as linking to related <a>Spatial Things</a>.</p>
              <p>In most cases, a web page about a Spatial Thing should include information on its location.  This can be done by providing spatial coordinates (see <a href="#bp-crs-choice">Best Practice 7</a> for guidance on how to do this).</p>
	              <p>A common way of specifying the location of a building is to use its postal address. Most spatial applications require an address to be turned into spatial coordinates, so that its location can be marked on a map, or compared with locations of other things, a process known as <a>geocoding</a>.  Although a publisher could leave this process of geocoding to the data user, ideally the publisher should take responsibility for this as they are in a better position to check the accuracy of the results.  Different ways of specifying addresses can sometimes lead to errors in the geocoding process.</p>

	              <p>Other approaches can be taken to specifying location. <a href="https://what3words.com/">What3words</a> is an example of a service that assigns an alternative kind of address to a location - in this case a sequence of three common words associated with a 3m by 3m square on the ground.  It allows every location to be given such an address and what3words also provides a means to relate the address to <a>latitude</a> and <a>longitude</a> coordinates.  Like conventional addresses, converting to coordinates is necessary for many spatial data applications (e.g. to calculate the distance between points or whether a point is inside a region), but the process of conversion is more reliable and precise.</p>
              <aside class="example">
                <p>Wikipedia includes web pages about many Spatial Things, for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cathedral">Florence Cathedral</a>.  This page provides latitude and longitude coordinates for the cathedral, as well as linking to other pages about the city of Florence and the region of Tuscany.  It would be better if typical Wikipedia pages about Spatial Things were explicit about the coordinate reference system used. However, a link is also provided to the 'Geohack' service which provides detailed location information, including the CRS.</p>
              </aside>
              <h5>2. Web mapping or visualization applications</h5>
              <p>A common application of <a>spatial data</a> on the Web is delivering map data in a tiled form, suitable for display in zoomable 'slippy maps'.  The OGC's <a>Web Map Tile Service</a> [[WMTS]] is an established standard for doing this.  Other approaches in common use include <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec">MBTiles</a> or 'Tile layers' in <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps APIs</a></p>
              <p>Another frequent requirement is to draw markers or polygons on top of a Web map. A typical approach is for the browser to display a base map, then separately retrieve data about <a>Spatial Things</a> of interest, typically as GeoJSON [[RFC7946]], [[GeoRSS]] feeds, [[GML]] using the Simple Features profile [[GML-SF]] or [[KML]] files, then combine the two using appropriate JavaScript libraries.  For applications involving boundary polygons of geographical areas, a common consideration is how to make this process efficient at different zoom levels. A high level of detail is appropriate when zoomed in, but many areas may be visible when zoomed out, and delivering boundaries of all of those at full detail can lead to very large amounts of data and hence poor performance, so simplified lower resolution versions of polygons may be required.</p>
<p>See this <a href="#table-formats-matrix">comparison of different spatial data formats</a> to help guide the choice of which approach is best suited to your purpose.</p>
              <aside class="example">
                <p><a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a> is a widely used JavaScript library for creating visualizations in web pages. This <a href="https://medium.com/@mbostock/command-line-cartography-part-1-897aa8f8ca2c">tutorial by Mike Bostock</a> describes how to use D3 to work with geometrical data and display it in a web page.</p>
              </aside>
              <h5>3. Data integration - combining spatial data with other data</h5>
              <p>Many important applications of <a>spatial data</a> involve combining it with other kinds of data: for example, opening times of nearby supermarkets, or statistical information on the economy of a town.  Often one or more <a>Spatial Things</a> are at the center of the data analysis process.</p>
              <p>Other applications involve distinguishing or selecting <a>Spatial Things</a> according to their non-spatial characteristics: hospitals with an emergency department, or restaurants that serve Japanese food.</p>
              <p>To enable such questions to be answered using data from different sources, it is important to describe <a>Spatial Things</a> using shared identifiers and vocabularies.  This is described in [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#identifiersWithinDatasets">Best Practice 10: Use persistent URIs as identifiers within datasets</a> and [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#ReuseVocabularies">Best Practice 15: Reuse vocabularies, preferably standardized ones</a>.</p>
              <p>From a <a>spatial data</a> perspective, the question of identifiers is discussed in <a href="#globally-unique-ids" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 1</a>.  How to relate a <a>Spatial Thing</a> to its <a>geometry</a> is described in <a href="#describe-geometry" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 5: Provide geometries on the Web in a usable way</a>.</p>
              <p>A common approach to encoding data to enable data integration is <a>Linked Data</a> [[LD-BP]] and <a>RDF</a> [[RDF11-PRIMER]]. The spatial aspects of the data can either be included in the RDF data model, or the entity in question can link to an external Web resource containing the <a>geometry</a> in one of the standard spatial data formats. Although RDF is well-suited to important aspects of best practice, including use of URIs as identifiers and re-use of vocabularies, other data formats are also consistent with this approach. Most spatial data formats enable associating attributes of an entity alongside its geometry.</p>	
              <p>The publisher's choice of data model to represent the data will depend on what data is available and which audiences and purposes it seems most important to support. However, a reasonable general rule is that it is always useful to provide a label and a type for each entity in the data collection. (See [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#ChooseRightFormalizationLevel">Best Practice 16: Choose the right formalization level</a>)</p> 
	              <p>Common vocabularies for describing the address or location of a <a>Spatial Thing</a> include: [[SCHEMA-ORG]], [[VCARD-RDF]] and [[LOCN]]. See this <a href="#table-vocabs-matrix">comparison of different vocabularies for describing Spatial Things</a> to help decide which is best for your application.</p> 
	              <p>Publishing explicit relationships between the Spatial Thing of interest and other related Spatial Things helps support data integration applications: for example providing hierarchical relationships between different kinds of administrative area.</p>

              <aside class="example">
                <p>The Scottish Government makes a lot of statistical data available via their website <a href="http://statistics.gov.scot">Statistics.gov.scot</a>. Every statistical data point is referred to a geographical area, identified by an HTTP URI, making it easy to compare different datasets about an area of interest.  See for example this page about the <a href="http://statistics.gov.scot/id/statistical-geography/S12000036">City of Edinburgh Council Area</a>.</p>
              </aside>
              <h5>4. Spatial analytics - discover meaningful patterns in spatial data</h5>
				  <p>Spatial analytics (or spatial analysis) is about deriving new insights by applying formal techniques to study <a>Spatial Things</a> using their topological or geometric properties. Combining <a>spatial data</a> with other data (see item 3 above) is a typical preparatory step before analyzing the one or more datasets using <a>spatial operators</a>, statistical algorithms, etc.</p>
              <p>For spatial analytics on the Web, the data should be accessible via an API as described in <a href="#bp-exposing-via-api" class="sectionRef"></a> and results should be shared using the best practices described in this document. Current <a>spatial data infrastructures</a> have some limitations with respect to sharing spatial data on the Web (as discussed in <a href="#why-are-traditional-sdi-not-enough" class="sectionRef"></a>). Nonetheless this approach is a well-established and powerful way of distributing <a>spatial data</a>, based on open standards and suited to a community of expert users. It is thus one of the options a data publisher should consider when deciding how to encode their <a>spatial data</a>.</p>
              <p>In addition to publishing the data that represents the results of the analysis, maps and other forms of visualization (see item 2 above) are typically used to communicate the results.</p>
              <aside class="example">
                <p>Statistics Netherlands (CBS) publishes their <a href="https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/onze-diensten/methoden/onderzoeksomschrijvingen/korte-onderzoeksbeschrijvingen/kerncijfers-wijken-en-buurten">Neighborhoods statistics data</a> as a [[WFS]] service. The capabilities of that service can be requested in the following way:</p>
                <code>https://geodata.nationaalgeoregister.nl/wijkenbuurten2016/wfs?request=GetCapabilities</code>
                <p>For example, the following request returns the data for neighborhoods within the specified bounding box. The bounding box is specified using <a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::28992">EPSG:28992</a> ("Amersfoort / RD New") and indicates an areay of 100 square meters.</p>

              </aside>
              <h4 class="subhead">Balancing quality and cost</h4>
              <p>The four main classes of application above have a wide range of requirements.  To support such a wide range may require a lot of effort and cost on behalf of a data publisher. There are many aspects to the 'quality' of a <a>spatial data</a> publishing approach, but in general terms it relates to how well the data and approach to data delivery meet the needs of the target audience.  By choosing to concentrate on only some kinds of application the publisher can keep cost down.  Other factors to consider include performance (speed with which data is delivered), timeliness of updates - which can be a significant consideration if the underlying data changes frequently, software complexity or maintenance. </p>
              <p>In many cases a mixture of technologies can be used together to find a good compromise of quality or performance and cost. The strengths of various approaches can be applied to the part of the publishing 'spectrum' that suits them best. For example, if using a <a>Linked Data</a> approach, one option is to keep all data in a <a>triple store</a>; but hybrid approaches are also possible, for example where geometrical information is stored and served from flat files, or where non-geometrical data and metadata is stored in a triple store and used to generate Web pages and machine readable descriptions of <a>Spatial Things</a>, while geometrical data is indexed by software such as Lucene Spatial, PostGIS or Elasticsearch. Use of shared Web-accessible identifiers for <a>Spatial Things</a> can help support the interconnections between a range of diverse information systems. </p>
<p>[[EO-QB]] describes a 'spectrum of linkiness' for coverage data. At one end of the spectrum, you can assign each individual data point or pixel within a coverage (such as a satellite image) an individual identifier and web page. At the other, you can link just to an entire dataset and provide metadata for that.  An intermediate approach involves dividing the data into tiles, each of which can have its own identifier and metadata. The balance of quality and cost in this example corresponds to the size of tiles that can be individually referenced, described and retrieved.</p>

          <h4>Geometries and coordinate reference systems</h4>
          <p>Location information is a common constituent of <a>spatial data</a> and can be an important 'hook' for finding information and for integrating different datasets. There are different ways of describing the location of <a>Spatial Things</a>. You can use and/or refer to the name of a well-known named place, provide position coordinates in a <a>geometry</a> or describe one location  relative to another location. Providing multiple representations i.e. several <a>geometries</a> for one <a>Spatial Thing</a> can also be helpful, allowing data users to choose the one that fits their use case. This generally requires each <a>geometry</a> to be represented as a structured object that includes not only coordinates of the positions defining the geometry but also an identifier and other properties that describe its specific characteristics.  It is especially important to choose the <a>coordinate reference system</a> with care and indicate it clearly for each <a>geometry</a>.</p>

          <p class="practicedesc"><a>Geometry</a> data should be expressed in a way that allows its publication and use on the Web.</p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
            <p>The geospatial, Linked Data, and Web communities use different <a>geometry</a> formats and tools, which reflect different requirements with respect to data complexity and manipulation.</p>
            <p>When deciding how a <a>geometry</a> should be described, it is therefore necessary to consider the intended uses and the related user communities. This may also imply providing alternative geometry descriptions.</p>
            <p>This best practice helps with choosing the right format for describing <a>geometries</a>, based on aspects like intended use(s), performance, and tool support. It also helps with deciding when encoding geometries as literals rather than as structured objects is a useful simplification.</p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>This best practice is strictly correlated to <a href="#multiplegeometries" class="sectionRef"></a>, <a href="#bp-crs-choice" class="sectionRef"></a>, and <a href="#bp-crs" class="sectionRef"></a>, to which we refer the reader for more information.</p>

          <section class="outcome">
            <h4 class="subhead">Intended Outcome</h4>
            <p>The format chosen to express geometry data should:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Support the <a>dimensionality</a> of the <a>geometry</a> (from points - 0D - to volumes - 3D) - not all geometry formats support all dimensions.</li>
              <li>Support the <a>coordinate reference system</a> you need.</li>
              <li>Be supported by the software tools used within particular data user communities - the geospatial and Web communities use different tools often suited to different geometry formats.</li>
              <li>Keep geometry definitions to a level of detail and size that is appropriate for the intended applications - Web applications do not typically require detailed <a>geometries</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ideally, to enable their widest re-use, <a>geometries</a> should be described having in mind the geospatial, Linked Data and Web communities. This may not be always feasible, but the objective should at least be to describe geometries (also) for Web consumption.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
            <p>Steps to follow:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identify the intended uses and applications. In particular, it is important to verify if <a>geometries</a> need to be used in one or more of the following scenarios:
                <ul>
                  <li>specific geospatial applications;</li>
                  <li><a>linked data</a> applications;</li>
                  <li>Web consumption.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>For each of the intended uses / applications, provide possibly alternative descriptions of geometries, considering:
                <ul>
                  <li>The appropriate <a>geometry</a> <a>dimensionality</a> (0D - points, 1D - curves, 2D - surfaces, 3D - solids). See <a href="#spatial-things-features-and-geometry" class="sectionRef"></a> for more information.</li>
                  <li>The appropriate <a>coordinate reference system</a>(s). See <a href="#CRS-background" class="sectionRef"></a> for more information.</li>
                  <li>The appropriate geometry encoding(s) / representation(s) - also considering the software tools that you anticipate your user community to employ. See <a href="#applicability-formatVbp" class="sectionRef"></a> for more information.</li>
                  <li>The appropriate level of detail. See <a href="#multiplegeometries" class="sectionRef"></a> for more information.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Where multiple representations are required, consider offering as many as you can - balancing the benefit of ease of use against the cost of the additional storage or additional processing if converting on-the-fly. See [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#Conneg" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 19: Use content negotiation for serving data available in multiple formats</a> for more information.
                <div class="note">
                  <p>HTTP content negotiation only works for media-type, character set, encoding and language. Consequently, it is not possible to select one representation that conforms to a given "profile" (e.g. data model, complexity level, <a>CRS</a>) from several that all share the same media-type; e.g. asking for the GeoJSON [[RFC7946]] features with "simple" <a>geometries</a> (compacted polygons or just points) not the "complex" geometries; or asking for the representation that uses CRS84 not Amersfoort-RD.</p>
                </div>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is important to note that the steps outlined above are interrelated. For instance, the <a>dimensionality</a> of a <a>geometry</a> determines the set of <a>coordinate reference systems</a> that can be used, as well as the geometry encodings / representations.</p>
            <p>Another issue to be considered when choosing the geometry format is whether the coordinate axis order is unambiguous - i.e., whether the order of the position coordinates defining each geometry is, e.g., <a>longitude</a>/<a>latitude</a> or latitude/longitude. This specific topic is covered by <a href="#bp-crs"></a>.</p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>Multiple formats exist for representing <a>geometries</a> (and some of them are listed in <a href="#applicability-formatVbp" class="sectionRef"></a>). It is important to distinguish between the structured <a>geometry</a> object itself and the list of two or more position coordinates that places that geometry in space and is typically the most voluminous part of geometry data. Another of the issues to be considered when choosing the format(s) to be supported is where and when to use literals or structured object formats.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>For <a>geometry</a> literals, several encodings are available, such as Well-Known Text (<a>WKT</a>) representations, <a>Geohash</a> and other <a>geocoding</a> representations. Literals may lend themselves to compact storage and fast processing, but have the disadvantage that properties of the geometry are not readily Web-accessible. An alternative is to use structured geometry objects. [[GeoSPARQL]], for example, balances accessibility and compactness by using a literal such as <a>WKT</a> to encode just the position list of a <a>geometry</a> but represents other properties in RDF .</li>
                <li>There are also several suitable binary data formats (e.g. <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">Google's protocol buffers</a> for vector tiling); however, some binary formats do not (effectively) work on the Web as there are no software tools for working with those formats from within a typical Web application; to work with data in such formats, you must first download the data and then work with it locally.</li>
                <li>There are widespread practices for representing geometric data as <a>linked data</a>, such as using [[W3C-BASIC-GEO]] <code>w3cgeo:lat</code> and <code>w3cgeo:long</code> that are used extensively for describing <code>w3cgeo:Point</code> objects.</li>
                <li>Concrete geometry types are available, such as those defined in the OpenGIS [[SIMPLE-FEATURES]] Specification, namely 0-dimensional Point and MultiPoint; 1-dimensional curve LineString and MultiLineString; 2-dimensional surface Polygon and MultiPolygon; and the heterogeneous GeometryCollection. </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Currently, there are two reference <a>geometry</a> formats widely used in the geospatial and Web communities, respectively, [[GML]] and GeoJSON [[RFC7946]].</p>
            <p>[[GML]] provides the ability to express any type of <a>geometry</a>, in any <a>coordinate reference system</a>, and up to 3 <a>dimensions</a> (from points to solids) but is typically serialized in <a>XML</a> [[XML11]].</p>
            <p>GeoJSON [[RFC7946]] supports only one <a>coordinate reference system</a> (CRS84 - i.e., WGS 84 longitude/latitude), and <a>geometries</a> up to 2 dimensions (points, lines, surfaces) but is serialized in <a>JSON</a> [[RFC7159]], which is often easier for browser-based Web applications to process.</p>
            <p>To facilitate the use of <a>geometry</a> data on the Web as well in <a>GIS</a>, it is desirable that complex [[GML]]-encoded geometries be made available also in simplified form as GeoJSON [[RFC7946]], by applying any required <a>coordinate reference system</a> transformation, as well as simplifying and generalizing the original geometry as needed (e.g., by transforming a 3D geometry into a 2D one). Simplified geometries may of course also be published in [[GML]], for example by conforming to the GML Simple Feature profile [[GML-SF]]. (On this topic, see <a href="#multiplegeometries" class="sectionRef"></a>).</p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>Another approach to publishing <a>geometries</a> on the Web is to embed them directly in Web pages. This is, for instance, the approach used by [[SCHEMA-ORG]], which defines several terms to specify them (see <a href="#indexable-by-search-engines" class="sectionRef"></a> for more information).</p>
              <p>Typically, this is used just for 0D-2D <a>geometries</a> (points, lines, surfaces). Detailed and complex geometries cannot be published with this methodology, so also in this case only a very simplified representation of the original <a>geometry</a> can be published - e.g., the centroid and/or 2D bounding box. (On this topic, see <a href="#multiplegeometries" class="sectionRef"></a>).</p>
            </div>
            <p>Finally, <a>RDF</a>-based representations of <a>geometries</a> are used in the Linked Data community. This is achieved by using specific vocabularies, as [[W3C-BASIC-GEO]] (only for points), [[GeoRSS]] (points, lines, boxes, circles, polygons) or [[GeoSPARQL]] (for any simple features geometries). For a high-level comparison of common spatial data vocabularies, see <a href="#applicability-formatVbp" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>
            <p>These <a>geometry</a> representations are either stored with the related data, or are maintained separately, and possibly denoted with HTTP URIs (see <a href="#ex-http-uris-for-geometries"></a>).</p>
            <p><a>RDF</a> representations of <a>geometries</a> can support most <a>geometry</a> types and <a>dimensions</a> (up to at least 2 dimensions), with any level of complexity, in any <a>coordinate reference system</a>. On the other hand, many existing <a>Semantic Web</a> tools such as <a>triple stores</a> are currently not efficient enough to perform spatial queries which are complex and/or on complex geometries. It may therefore preferable to maintain geometries separately, in software platforms designed for these specific tasks.</p>
            <p>It is nonetheless still desirable to make simplified <a>geometries</a> available for Web consumption in GeoJSON [[RFC7946]] or embedded in Web pages.</p>
            <p>The following [[TURTLE]] snippet shows the [[GeoDCAT-AP]] representation of the dataset in <a href="#ex-schemaorg-dataset-and-place"></a>. Here the bounding box is provided in multiple literal encodings (<a>WKT</a>, [[GML]], GeoJSON [[RFC7946]]), by using property <code>locn:geometry</code> [[LOCN]].</p>

            <p>In the above example, the <a>coordinate reference system</a> used for the bounding box is CRS84 (equivalent to WGS 84, but with coordinate axis-order longitude/latitude), which is explicitly specified in the [[GML]] encoding via attribute <code>@srsName</code>, and by using the relevant HTTP URI from the <a href="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0">OGC CRS registry</a>. The <a>coordinate reference system</a> is not specified for the <a>WKT</a> encoding, since CRS84 is the default <a>coordinate reference system</a> for <a>WKT</a> in [[GeoSPARQL]], and therefore it can be omitted.

            <p>The different <a>WKT</a> encodings in the example show alternative ways of specifying the <a>coordinate reference system</a> used.</p>
            <p>The two instances of property <code>geosparql:asWKT</code> follow the syntax recommended in [[GeoSPARQL]], where the specification of the <a>coordinate reference system</a> is required only if different from CRS84. By contrast, property <code>pdok:asWKT-RD</code> implies the use of a specific <a>coordinate reference system</a>, namely, <a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::28992">EPSG:28992</a> ("Amersfoort / RD New"). The coordinate axis-order used is determined here by the <a>coordinate reference system</a>, and in both cases, it is longitude / latitude (more precisely, east/north for EPSG:28992).<!-- By contrast, the coordinates for the bounding box and centroid use WGS 84, with coordinate axis-order latitude / longitude.--></p>
            <p><a href="#ex-anne-frank-building-rdf"></a> shows also how <a>geometries</a> for <a>Spatial Things</a> can be published as separate Web resources. This approach can be particularly suitable for giving access to huge geometries, consisting of hundreds of vertex positions (as the detailed <a>geometry</a> of the boundaries of a geographical region), without attaching them to the relevant <a>Spatial Things</a>. Moreover, this allows the same geometry to be linked from (i.e., re-used by) different Spatial Things. Finally, it is possible to use mechanisms (including HTTP content negotiation) to provide access to different representations / encodings of the geometry ([[GML]], <a>WKT</a>, GeoJSON [[RFC7946]], etc.) as media types, thus addressing different use cases. (On this topic, see also <a href="#entity-level-links"></a>).</p>
            <aside class="example" id="ex-http-uris-for-geometries" title="HTTP URIs for geometries">
              <p>As shown in <a href="#ex-amsterdam-station-uri" class="exampleRef"></a>, the following URI:</p>
              <p><code>https://brt.basisregistraties.overheid.nl/top10nl/id/gebouw/102625209</code></p>
              <p>denotes Amsterdam Central train station. However, its <a>geometry</a> is provided as a separate, standalone resource, denoted by the following URI:</p>
              <p><code>https://brt.basisregistraties.overheid.nl/top10nl/id/geometry/2525562935f2c33152e98f65f9d8d6ff</code></p>
              <p>A similar approach is used by Ordnance Survey. For instance, North Devon is denoted by the following URI:</p>
              <p><code>http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/7000000000022933</code></p>
              <p>whereas its <a>geometry</a> is denoted by:</p>
              <p><code>http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/geometry/22933-4</code></p>
              <p>An additional example is the API of the <a href="http://gadm.geovocab.org/">GADM-RDF project</a>, providing access to spatial <a>linked data</a> concerning administrative areas. For instance, the following URI <a href="http://gadm.geovocab.org/id/0/60"><code>http://gadm.geovocab.org/id/0/60</code></a> returns a description of administrative area "Germany", which links to the geometry of Germany's boundaries, provided via a separate URI: <a href="http://gadm.geovocab.org/id/0/60/geometry"><code>http://gadm.geovocab.org/id/0/60/geometry</code></a>.</p>
              <p>Dereferencing the <a>geometry</a> URIs operated by the GADM-RDF API returns different geometry representations / encodings (SVG included), that can be accessed via HTTP content negotiation or by appending the format extension to the URI. For instance, URI <a href="http://gadm.geovocab.org/id/0/60/geometry.geojson"><code>http://gadm.geovocab.org/id/0/60/geometry.geojson</code></a> returns the GeoJSON [[RFC7946]] representation of the geometry. Direct <a>links</a> to the supported geometry representations / encodings are specified in the <a>RDF</a> and HTML representations of the geometry.</p>

<p><span id="multiplegeometries" class="practicelab">Provide geometries at the right level of accuracy, precision, and size</span></p>
<p class="practicedesc"><a>Geometry</a> data should be provided at levels of accuracy, precision, and size fit for their use on the Web.</p>
<section class="axioms">
<h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
<p><a>Geometry</a> data always provide an approximate description of the shape and <a>extent</a> of <a>Spatial Things</a>, which is fit for specific uses. For instance, portraying a geometry on a Web map would typically not require the level of detail that is needed for using the same geometry for spatial analysis. Moreover, although a 3D description of a geometry of a building might be available, a Web map would be typically capable of portraying just its 2-dimensional footprint.</p>
<p>Other issues to be taken into account are network bandwidth and the processing capabilities of the target tools. For instance, a <a>geometry</a> of a total size of 1GB or more, could be more efficiently transmitted after being compressed. On the other hand, a tool with limited processing capabilities (as a Web browser) may not be able to efficiently handle such geometry (e.g., for displaying it on a Web map).</p>
<p>This best practice complements <a href="#describe-geometry"></a> by outlining some of the approaches that can be used to publish alternative versions of <a>geometry</a> data, with respect to the level of accuracy, precision, and size, fit for the most general use cases and the reference target communities.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>This best practice is not meant to provide detailed guidelines on (a) which is the right level of accuracy and precision for different use cases, or (b) how to generate and publish alternative <a>geometries</a> for <a>Spatial Things</a>. On these specific topics, we refer the reader to, respectively, <a href="#convenience-apis"></a> and <a href="#desc-accuracy"></a>.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="outcome">
<h4 class="subhead">Intended Outcome</h4>
<p><a>Geometry</a> data should be made available at (possibly different) levels of accuracy, precision, and size, taking into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>The required level of precision and accuracy of the intended use case(s).</li>
<li>The processing capabilities of the target tools.</li>
<li>Optimization in terms of network bandwidth consumption</li>
</ul>
<p>As said in <a href="#describe-geometry"></a>, the requirements of the geospatial, Linked Data and Web communities should be ideally taken into account also with respect to the accuracy, precision, and size of <a>geometry</a> data. Whenever this is not feasible, Web consumption requirements should at least be addressed.</p>
</section>
<section class="how">
<h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
<p>A number of techniques can be used to deliver representations of <a>geometries</a> at an accuracy, precision, and size fitting the requirements of a given use case.</p>
<p>The following list, although not exhaustive, outlines the approaches most widely used, especially for the Web delivery and consumption of <a>geometry</a> data.</p>
<p>Choosing the right technique requires taking primarily into account whether the derived <a>geometry</a> is fit for the target use case. Technical limits - as network bandwidth and processing capabilities - are of course important, but secondary. Of course, the ideal situation is when you are able to find the technique offering the right trade-off between these two types of requirements.</p>
<p>Whatever option is used, the key requirement is that the derived <a>geometry</a> data are not replacing the original ones, but are made available as alternative representations.</p>
  <p><a href="#describe-geometry"></a>, <a href="#desc-accuracy"></a> and <a href="#convenience-apis"></a> provide general guidelines that can be used for the publication of alternative representations of <a>geometries</a>, providing at the same time information on their characteristics. These include, but are not limited to, the use of different URIs for different representations, and HTTP content negotiation. Moreover, whenever <a>geometry</a> data are made available in <a>RDF</a> [[RDF11-PRIMER]], specific properties can be used to specify the geometry type and the level of accuracy and precision. More specific examples are included in the approaches described below.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Compress <a>geometry</a> data</p>
<p>Using standard compression algorithms, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_%28file_format%29">zip</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip">gzip</a>, addresses the issue of efficient transmission of <a>geometry</a> data, without information loss. Notably, some formats come with alternative compressed encodings - e.g., <a href="https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmzarchives">KMZ</a> is used to deliver compressed [[KML]] data.</p>
<p>Compression can be easily carried out on the fly, and it is also supported by the HTTP protocol via content negotiation - see [[RFC2616]], <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.5">section 3.5: Content Codings</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use formats optimizing access to and processing of <a>geometry</a> data</p>
<p>Some formats support a more compact description of <a>geometry</a> data, which potentially results in reducing network bandwidth consumption and/or more efficient client-side processing.</p>
  <p>This is for instance the case of <a href="https://github.com/topojson/topojson">TopoJSON</a>, an extension to GeoJSON [[RFC7946]] which reduces redundancy in the description of a geometry, by splitting it into segments (referred to as "arcs") that can be re-used.</p>
  <p>To achieve the same results, other formats are designed to enable the stream-based delivery of geometry data. For instance, GeoJSON Text Sequences [[RFC8142]] is a format designed to optimize access and processing of GeoJSON [[RFC7946]] data, by enabling a client application to use the received data even before the transmission is completed.</p>
  <p>Another approach, focused on efficient client-side processing, is <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/geojson-vt">GeoJSON-VT</a>, a library which enables a client to create on the fly vector tiles from GeoJSON [[RFC7946]] data.</p>
<p>Finally, <a>Geohash</a> provides a compact way of encoding 0-dimensional <a>geometries</a> (points), which, at the same time, can be used for spatial indexing.</p>
<aside class="example" id="ex-anne-frank-address-geohash">
<p>The point coordinates of the address of Anne Frank's House (see <a href="#ex-schemaorg-dataset-and-place"></a>) can be encoded with <a>Geohash</a> as <a href="http://geohash.org/u173zns7thy"><code>u173zns7thy</code></a> (corresponding to the following WGS 84 lat/long coordinates: <code>52.37520</code> <code>4.88399</code>).</p>
</aside>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide geometries at different levels of generalization</p>
<p>Generalization is a traditional technique used in <a>spatial data</a> - first of all, in cartography - to reduce the precision and/or accuracy of a <a>geometry</a> for specific purposes. A typical example is provided by how geometries are portrayed in maps of different scales: for instance, a large-scale map can depict the width of a road (2-dimensional geometry), whereas, at lower scales, the same road can be shown as a line with zero width (1-dimensional geometry).</p>
<p>Providing <a>geometries</a> at different scales or resolutions is actually one of the first criteria to be considered for addressing different use cases. This is common practice in the geospatial domain, especially, but not only, for reference data. For instance, the dataset of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/">Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics</a> (NUTS) of the European Union is made available at five different scales - ranging from 1:1,000,000 to 1:60,000,000.</p>
<aside class="example" id="ex-admin-areas-at-different-resolution" title="">
<p>The <a href="http://gadm.geovocab.org/">GADM-RDF project</a> provides access to <a>geometries</a> of administrative areas at a resolution of 100m, 1km, 10km, and 100km. Each of these variants is associated with a different HTTP URI, and <a>geometry</a> data are made available in different formats. For instance, the geometry of Germany at 100m resolution is denoted by the following URI <a href="http://gadm.geovocab.org/id/0/60/geometry_100m"><code>http://gadm.geovocab.org/id/0/60/geometry_100m</code></a>, whereas the variant at 100km resolution is available from the following URI: <a href="http://gadm.geovocab.org/id/0/60/geometry_100km"><code>http://gadm.geovocab.org/id/0/60/geometry_100km</code></a> (see also <a href="#ex-http-uris-for-geometries"></a>).</p>
</aside>
<p>Scale reduction uses a number of generalization techniques that can be used also outside this specific use case in order to provide <a>geometries</a> at different levels of accuracy and precision.</p>
<p>These techniques include the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Reducing precision</dt>
<dd>It boils down to reducing the number of decimals in point coordinates of a <a>geometry</a>. This feature is widely supported in geospatial tools and Web libraries, and it provides a way to effectively reduce the size of geometry data without losing too much information about its shape.
<div class="note">
  <p>The precision with which coordinate positions are reported often do not reflect the accuracy of the measurement. For example, <a>latitude</a> and <a>longitude</a> reported to six decimal places corresponds to a precision of around 1cm on the ground. GPS-enabled consumer devices are accurate to within a few meters: centimeter-accuracy can only be achieved with professional equipment. Yet a lot of software defaults to use of six, seven or even more decimal places when expressing coordinate positions which may mislead users to thinking that the data is more accurate than it actually is!</p>
  <p><a href="#desc-accuracy" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 14: Describe the positional accuracy of spatial data</a> for a discussion on precision and accuracy.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Simplification</dt>
<dd>This basically consists in reducing the number of point coordinates of a <a>geometry</a>. Examples of algorithms used for this purpose are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm">Ramer-Douglas-Peucker</a> (RDP) and <a href="https://hydra.hull.ac.uk/resources/hull:8338">Visvalingam-Whyatt</a>.</dd>
<dt>Conversion of geometry <a>dimensions</a></dt>
<dd>One of the cases is the example mentioned earlier in this section, where the <a>geometry</a> of a road, originally, 2-dimensional, is converted into a 1-dimensional object (a line). This can also apply to conversion from 3-dimensional <a>geometries</a> into 2-dimensional ones (e.g., the 3D representation of a building is converted into its 2D footprint), and to conversion of an <var>n</var>-dimensional geometry into a point.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide the centroid and bounding box of a geometry</p>
<p>Centroids and bounding boxes are another example of how a <a>geometry</a> can be generalized, but serving different purposes. More precisely, a centroid is meant to specify the position of a <a>Spatial Thing</a> by converting its actual geometry to a point, corresponding to its center. On the other hand, a bounding box provides a simplified description of the maximum <a>extent</a> of a <a>Spatial Thing</a>.</p>
<p>Although both these generalization methodologies result in a high-level information loss with respect to the original <a>geometry</a>, they play an important role in spatial analysis because of the topological information they provide. Moreover, centroids and bounding boxes could provide an accurate enough description of a geometry for those use cases where, respectively, the extent or precise shape of a <a>Spatial Thing</a> is not relevant. Finally, they are widely used also outside the geospatial domain.</p>
<p>Computation of centroids and bounding boxes is supported by all <a>GIS</a> tools and Web mapping libraries, which makes it possible to be carried out on the fly. However, performing this operation client-side can be extremely inefficient if the target tool has limited processing capabilities.</p>
<p>This issue can be addressed by providing access to centroids and bounding boxes as alternative representations of a given <a>geometry</a>.</p>
<aside class="example" id="ex-anne-frank-building-centroid-and-bbox">
<p>In the following [[TURTLE]] snippet, [[W3C-BASIC-GEO]] and [[GeoRSS]] are used to specify, respectively, the centroid (<code>w3cgeo:lat</code> and <code>w3cgeo:long</code>) and bounding box (<code>georss:box</code>) of the 2-dimensional footprint of the building hosting Anne Frank's Museum (see <a href="#ex-anne-frank-building-rdf"></a>).</p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
            <p>A multitude of <a>coordinate reference systems</a> exist because there is no perfect solution to meet all requirements:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>The Earth is a complicated shape (neither spherical nor flat!):</p>
                <p>For each (Earth-based) <a>coordinate reference system</a>, the topographical surface of the Earth is approximated to a <em>geodetic <a>datum</a></em> that is described using an <a>ellipsoid</a>. The trouble with approximation is that nothing is perfect everywhere, which means that compromise is inevitable. Some datums, like WGS 84, provide a reasonable (but not highly accurate) fit everywhere on the Earth, while other datums (such as the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 - as used by <a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4258">ETRS89 / EPSG:4258</a>) provide a better fit in a given region at the expense of accuracy elsewhere.</p>
                <p><a>Spatial data</a> is often <em>projected</em> from the curved surface of the Earth onto a flat plane (e.g. a computer screen or a topographical map) to make it easier to compute distances between positions and calculate areas. There are many choices of projection (e.g. equirectangular, mercator, stereographic, orthographic etc.), each of which is designed for particular tasks. As with <a>datums</a>, projections are often chosen to better support regional, national or local needs.</p>
                <p>It is also worth noting that as a living planet, the Earth continues to change its shape; for example, continental drift moves Australia north-eastwards several centimeters each year and New Zealand shifts in multiple directions. To retain accuracy, <a>datums</a> need to be adjusted from time to time - as is the case of the New Zealand Geodetic Datum (NZGD2000) that is frequently revised to take account of earth deformations.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Sometimes we don't want to measure relative to the surface of the Earth at all:</p>
                <p><a>Spatial data</a> such as descriptions of the built environment, geological surveys, satellite imagery, etc. are often captured and stored in an <em>engineering</em> <a>coordinate reference system</a> as measurements from a local datum. For example, <em>X</em>  <em>Y</em> survey coordinates relative to a building corner, pixel positions within the image swath of a satellite camera, or distance along a line from a fixed origin point.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Although it is possible to convert coordinates from one <a>CRS</a> to another, many users will be put off by the need to do so. Furthermore, the need for such transformations introduces a point where errors can be introduced to the <a>spatial data</a> - especially where users have limited expertise with spatial data.</p>
            
            <p>When publishing <a>spatial data</a>, it is best to help users avoid the need for them to transform spatial data between <a>coordinate reference systems</a> themselves by providing data in a form, or forms, which they can use directly. To determine which coordinate reference system(s) are needed, data publishers must consider the intended applications of their user community.</p>

            <h4 class="subhead">Intended Outcome</h4>
            <p><a>Spatial data</a> is provided in a <a>coordinate reference system</a>, or systems, that are sensitive to the needs of user's intended applications.</p>
            <p>Most of a publisher's anticipated user community do not need to transform coordinate values prior to using the spatial data.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
            <div class="note">
              <p>Whichever <a>coordinate reference system</a> is chosen for the publication of <a>spatial data</a>, it is imperative that that choice is made clear to users. Please refer to <a href="#bp-crs" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 8: State how coordinate values are encoded</a> for further details.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The first thing that publishers of <a>spatial data</a> need to do is consider their audience.</p>
            
            <p>When publishing <a>spatial data</a> on the Web, the largest community of potential users will be unknown: anyone might find and use data published on the Web! To support this <em>unanticipated reuse</em>, we recommend <em>always</em> publishing your <a>spatial data</a> using a global <a>coordinate reference system</a> which allows spatial data from multiple sources to be readily combined for display or computation. For <a>geospatial data</a> with point, line or polygon <a>geometries</a> (i.e. <em>vector</em> data), WGS 84 Lat/Long (<a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326">EPSG:4326</a>) or WGS 84 Lat/Long/Elevation (<a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4979">EPSG:4979</a>) are good choices as many of the tools and applications used by Web developers are set up to use data from GPS-enabled mobile devices that all use WGS 84. Where you have geo-imagery (i.e. <em>raster</em> data, comprised of a rectangular pattern of pixels on a flat plane) it is best to use Web Mercator (<a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::3857">EPSG:3857</a>) which has global coverage.</p> 

            <div class="note">
              <p>Data publishers should be aware that the geodetic <a>datum</a> used by Web Mercator is spherical and not true to the shape of the earth. At high <a>latitudes</a>, this results in positional differences of up to 20 kilometers when compared with WGS 84. However, many Web-mapping tools transparently perform the necessary transformations to ensure that geospatial vector data is correctly plotted on the underlying base map.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Where considerations of the known user community (or communities) call for different <a>coordinate reference systems</a>, we recommend publishing <a>spatial data</a> in multiple representations: one for each of the prioritized coordinate reference systems. Clearly, the number of representations provided needs to be determined with respect to the associated effort. However, remember that a decision not to publish data in a priority <a>CRS</a> will result in each member of your user community needing to do that task - or them not using your data.</p>
            <p>Common reasons for needing to publish in additional coordinate reference systems include:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>publication through government data portals that require use of a <a>projected CRS</a> defined by the national mapping agency - and similar legislative requirements;</p>
                <p class="example">The <a href="https://bag.basisregistraties.overheid.nl/">Basisregistraties Adressen en Gebouwen</a> (BAG), or <em>Basic Registers for Addresses and Buildings</em>, provided by <a href="https://www.kadaster.nl/">Kadaster</a>, publishes data in both OGC CRS84 (using the WGS 84 geodetic <a>datum</a>) and the Amersfoort / RD (<a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::28992">EPSG:28992</a>) <a>coordinate reference systems</a>.</p>
                <p class="example">The INSPIRE Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Commission requires that the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 ETRS89 (<a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4258">EPSG:4258</a>) is used for the referencing of spatial datasets.</p>
              </li>
              <li>applications such as augmented reality, defense and precision agriculture that require coordinates to be accurate to tens of centimeters or less, thereby requiring the use of a <a>CRS</a> with an alternative geodetic <a>datum</a> that provides a superior fit for the local or regional geographic area - noting that every CRS and datum should define the geographic area within which it is intended to be used;</li>
              <li>the need to support applications that work in a local frame of reference using an engineering CRS - such as in an urban environment, inside a building complex or using chainage along a survey line;</li>
              <li>avoiding computationally intensive reprojection of raster data such as satellite imagery or base maps within end-user applications - which may mean publishing vector data in the same <a>projected CRS</a> so that can be easily aligned with the raster data; and </li>
              <li>the need to retain the integrity of raster data by publishing in its original projection, thereby avoiding modification of pixel values due to the reprojection.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="note">
              <p>There are many cases where WGS 84, or any Earth-based <a>coordinate reference system</a>, are not appropriate. For example, when describing location relative to other celestial bodies (e.g. Lunar geography, and <em>areography</em> - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Mars">geography of Mars</a>), the arrangement of cells on a microscope slide, tapes in a mass storage unit, or the position of an artifact in a museum warehouse. In such cases, publication of <a>spatial data</a> in WGS 84 is either impossible or provides no value.</p>
              <p>That said, many of these best practices are still relevant. In particular, see <a href="#relative-position" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 9: Describe relative positioning</a>.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="note">
              <p>Discussion of coordinate system transformations is beyond the scope of this best practice document: converting coordinates between <a>CRS</a>s that use different <a>datums</a> and or projections can be very involved. This is especially true where elevation values are missing from the source data. For reference, EPSG guidelines say that in such cases reasonable assumptions are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Height = 0 meters (i.e. we are standing on the surface of the <a>ellipsoid</a>); or</li>
                <li>The height is given by a digital elevation model (i.e. we are standing on the surface of the planet).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>That said, we note that there are several open source software implementations are available to help users do such conversions. These include: the <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">Geospatial Data Abstraction Library</a> (GDAL), the <a href="http://proj.osgeo.org/">Cartographic Projections Library</a> (PROJ.4), its associated <a href="http://proj4js.org/">JavaScript implementation</a> (PROJ4.JS) and the <a href="http://sis.apache.org/">Apache Spatial Information System Library</a> (SIS).</p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
            <p>The <a>geometry</a> of <a>Spatial Things</a> is described using position coordinates; for example, <a>latitude</a> and <a>longitude</a>. Because coordinates describe a position relative to a <a>datum</a> (e.g. zero latitude is the equator and zero longitude is the prime meridian - often the Greenwich Meridian), it is important to understand both the datum and the units that are used for coordinates along with the order which the coordinate axes are defined: the <a>coordinate reference system</a> (CRS). <a>Spatial data</a> is published in a wide variety of CRS. This variety can create confusion and inconsistencies in using and interpreting spatial data. Unless the CRS is known, errors are likely to be introduced when determining the position and extent of a <a>Spatial Thing</a> on the Earth and this makes comparing or combining spatial data from different sources extremely problematic.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="outcome">
            <h4 class="subhead">Intended Outcome</h4>
            <p>Sufficient information is provided to enable coordinates to be related to the correct position, thereby enabling <a>spatial data</a> to be correctly interpreted by humans and software agents.</p>
            <p><a>Spatial data</a> from different sources can be combined without introducing unwarranted positional errors.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
            <p>A user of <a>spatial data</a> will need to know:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>which coordinate value relates to which axis;</li>
              <li>what units used for each coordinate; and</li>
              <li>what <a>datum</a> is used</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="note">
              <p>There is a predominant view that "I just need to use <a>Lat</a> and <a>Long</a> - and I'm done".</p>
              <p>Although the clear majority of <a>spatial data</a> published on the Web uses WGS 84 Long/Lat (as used by GPS), we <em>strongly</em> recommend that spatial data is published with all the necessary information to interpret coordinate values. Even where the use of <a>latitude</a> and <a>longitude</a> angular measurements is obvious; the choices of <a>datum</a> and units of measurement have an impact. In particular, angular measurements appearing as floating point numbers are most likely to be provided in decimal degrees, but could also  be in radians or gons (also known as grads).</p>
              <p>The problem is that the assumption of a "predominant view" leads to ambiguity. For example, many spatial data users work entirely with information provided in their national <a>coordinate reference system</a> (such as the <em>Dutch Amersfoort / RD</em> <a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::28992">EPSG:28992</a> or <em>British National Grid</em> <a href="http://epsg-registry.org/?display=entity&urn=urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::27700">EPSG:27700</a>) which make all coordinates in WGS 84 Long/Lat (especially the negative numbers) utterly perplexing.</p>
              <p>In practice, a publisher not documenting their <a>CRS</a> and presuming that <a>latitude</a> and <a>longitude</a> can be treated as cartesian is often bailed out by fuzzy use cases and software that takes care of projections. However, CRS and coordinate <a>axis order</a> ambiguity leads sooner or later to serious and avoidable errors, while ignorance of <a>datums</a> and <a>map projections</a> leads to broken applications. Furthermore, these practices will also become less and less tenable as new applications such as Augmented Reality require higher data precision and accuracy.</p>

            <p>Geocentric <a>coordinate reference system</a>s describe position relative to the earth itself. It can also
              be valuable or even necessary to describe the position of an entity relative to a second entity. In some cases, this is
              a navigation convenience, for example a tour kiosk might be described as located between the Boston Common Frog Pond and the Park
              Street T entrance, or in one's lower left view when looking up at the Statehouse. In other cases of moving or generalized  entities, it may be that the 
              entity can only usefully be given a relative position. For example, a package is reported left on seat 32L1 on the #59 bus, or 
              part number PRG5460 is always located at position (51, 73, 3) in Acme warehouses.

            <p>Positioning of one entity (A) relative to another referenced entity (B) is a combination of two factors: the referencing target, 
              and the means of relative positioning. "Geocentric" referencing targets the planet itself or at least a fixed point on it. "Allocentric" 
              referencing targets another entity. "Egocentric" referencing targets a particular field of view of an observer or camera. Positioning 
              can take the form of a complete <a>coordinate reference system</a> (e.g. engineering <a>CRS</a>), a qualitative relation such as "beside", or a 
              quantitative relation such as "30m northwest"</p>

          <h4>Spatial links</h4>
          <p>The fundamentals of <a>links</a> and how they are encoded are described in <a href="#bp-linking" class="sectionRef"></a>. This section provides advice on the resources to use as the <em>source</em> and <em>target</em> of <a>links</a> in spatial data, and the common categories of link relation types that might be used.</p>

            <section class="axioms">
              <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
              <p>Geography is often described as the "glue that binds Linked Data"; the <a>links</a> between <a>Spatial Things</a> - and between other resources and <a>Spatial Things</a> - describe how the world around us is structured and interrelated and form an important facet of the Web of Data.</p>
  
              <p><a>Spatial relationships</a> can often be derived mathematically based on <a>geometry</a> - but this can be computationally expensive. <em>Topological</em> relationships such as these can be asserted, thereby removing the need to do geometry-based calculations. A useful secondary benefit is that these relationships are easier for humans to understand!</p>
  
              <p>Different authorities and agencies seek to describe the world around them by publishing spatial data, and in doing so, each minting their own URIs (as recommended in <a href="#globally-unique-ids" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 1: Use globally unique persistent HTTP URIs for Spatial Things</a>). Where <a>Spatial Things</a> are of common interest to multiple agents, it is almost inevitable that a given <a>Spatial Thing</a> will end up being identified with several URIs. Given necessary due diligence, multiple identifiers may be linked, thereby supporting combination of multiple sets of information and yielding new perspectives on Spatial Things. </p>

              <p>Application domains often require Spatial Things to be related; to convey the correct meaning, specific link relation types need to be used.</p>

              <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
  
              <p>Before examining the link relation types that might be used in spatial data, let's to consider <em>what</em> we should link to.</p>
  
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Link to the <a>Spatial Thing</a>.</p>
                  <p>The <a>geometry</a> description or <a>extent</a> of a <a>Spatial Thing</a> may be expressed using an object with its own URI. For example:</p>
                  <pre class="example" id="ex-linking-geometry-edinburgh" title="Independently identified geometry extent for the City of Edinburgh Council Area (TTL format)">
  @prefix rdfs:      &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt; .
  @prefix admingeo:  &lt;http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/ontology/admingeo/&gt; .
  @prefix geom:      &lt;http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/ontology/geometry/&gt;
  
  &lt;http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/7000000000030505&gt;
    a admingeo:District ;
    rdfs:label "City of Edinburgh" ;
    geom:extent &lt;http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/geometry/30505-11&gt; .
  
  &lt;http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/geometry/30505-11&gt;
    a geom:AbstractGeometry ;
    geom:asGML "&lt;gml:MultiPolygon&gt;...&lt;/gml:MultiPolygon&gt;"^^rdf:XMLLiteral ;
    geom:hectares 27300.411 .
                  </pre>
  
                  <p>As can be seen in the example above, the <a>geometry</a> <a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/geometry/30505-11"><code>30505-11</code></a> is an <em>attribute</em> of the <a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/7000000000030505">City of Edinburgh</a>. If your intent is to make a statement about, or refer to, the real-world entity then make sure you link to the <a>Spatial Thing</a> rather than the <a>geometry</a>. Furthermore, note that the geometry record may be updated and re-published with a new identifier, for example, if the city boundary was resurveyed and would then result in a broken <a>link</a>.</p>
                  <p>Data publishers should also be aware of a common pattern used in the publication of <a>Linked Data</a>, where the <a>Spatial Thing</a> and the information resource that describes it are identified separately &mdash; often, but not always, using <code>/id</code> as part of the URI for <a>Spatial Thing</a>, and <code>/doc</code> for the corresponding page/document/record. When the URI for the Spatial Thing is dereferenced, a <code>HTTP 303 (see other)</code> response is used to redirect the browser to the page/document/record URL. For example:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://statistics.gov.scot/id/statistical-geography/S12000036"><code>http://statistics.gov.scot<span style="text-decoration: underline;">/id</span>/statistical-geography/S12000036</code></a> redirects to <a href="http://statistics.gov.scot/doc/statistical-geography/S12000036"><code>http://statistics.gov.scot<span style="text-decoration: underline;">/doc</span>/statistical-geography/S12000036</code></a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anne_Frank_House"><code>http://dbpedia.org<span style="text-decoration: underline;">/resource</span>/Anne_Frank_House</code></a> redirects to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Anne_Frank_House"><code>http://dbpedia.org<span style="text-decoration: underline;">/page</span>/Anne_Frank_House</code></a></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>While this disambiguation has its advantages, it often seems to confuse users (and even some experts). Be aware of this <em>redirect</em> pattern, and make sure you use the correct URI i.e. the identifying one &mdash; especially if you're copying the URI from a browser's address bar which usually ends up showing the page/document/record URL.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Link to <a>Spatial Things</a> from popular repositories.</p>
                  <p>Linking with URIs from popular repositories may improve discoverability of your data. Not only does this provide users with better context by enabling them to browse the information published by the popular repository, it also helps relate your data with datasets from other parties who have also used those URIs as points of reference.</p>
                  <p>There are many popular repositories containing sets of identifiers for <a>Spatial Things</a>; the following list suggests the primary sources worth checking:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://dbpedia.org">DBpedia</a></li>
                    <li>National open spatial datasets such as are made available by for example the UK and Dutch governments.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Finding out which national open spatial datasets are available, and how they can be accessed, currently requires some insider knowledge &mdash; in most cases because these datasets are often not easily discoverable. Look for national data portals / geoportals such as <a href="http://nationaalgeoregister.nl/geonetwork/srv/dut/catalog.search">Nationaal Georegister</a> (Dutch national register of spatial datasets) or <a href="https://data.overheid.nl">Dataportaal van de Nederlandse overheid</a> (Dutch national governmental data portal).</p>
                  <p>Once you've found well-known URIs for <a>Spatial Things</a> that you want to link to, proceed to create <a>links</a> using properties such as those described above &mdash; <code>owl:sameAs</code> (if you're careful!) and <a href="http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#sfWithin"><code>geosparql:sfWithin</code></a>, or perhaps qualitative relationships like <a href="http://www.geonames.org/ontology#nearby"><code>geonames:nearby</code></a> or the <em>proposed</em> <code>schema:samePlaceAs</code> (see related discussion in <a href="#c-sameplaceas" class="sectionRef"></a>).</p>
                  <p>However, don't try to make <a>links</a> to <em>everything</em>. It is not always feasible to link your <a>Spatial Things</a> to well-known resources. For example, if you were maintaining a registry of cultural heritage in Amsterdam, it would be reasonably simple to look up identifiers for the city's 50 or so museums and map these to your Spatial Things. But it would be a huge task for, say, a topographic mapping agency to cross-reference their entire catalogue of named places containing tens of thousands of Spatial Things with third-party resources (although in the spirit of crowd-sourcing, if someone else found those links useful, they may take on the task of relating the Spatial Things and publishing those relationships to the Web as a complementary resource!). In essence, you should only create the data that you have the resources to maintain.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>Now, let's take a look at link relation types that may be applicable to spatial data. These fall in to three broad categories: spatial relations, equality relations and domain-specific relations.</p> 

              <p>In this best practice document, we cannot cover all the possible vocabularies and ontologies that provide link relation types for spatial data. Other than a few areas of specific guidance, we are not recommending specific vocabularies for spatial linking. Instead, we hope to have introduced patterns that show the types of spatial linking that might be used and leave it to spatial data publishers to determine which specific vocabulary best suits their purpose. In this regard, [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#dataVocabularies">section 8.9 Data Vocabularies</a> and, in particular, [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#ReuseVocabularies">Best Practice 15: Reuse vocabularies, preferably standardized ones</a> are highly relevant.</p> 

              <p>Also, readers should note that in many cases, there will often be value in linking <a>Spatial Things</a> with multiple relationships &mdash; each of which provides different semantics. Having identified your intended user communities and the vocabularies that they commonly use, choose those <a>link</a> relation types that meet their specific needs, and then add more generalized <a>link</a> relation types to support broader reuse of your data.</p>

              <p>However, data publishers should only assert those relationships that they know about and that they think will be of interest to their user community. Don't try to cover all possible requirements! That said, publishers should try to avoid making assumptions about what the user may or may not know. For example, users may lack the expertise or resources to calculate a topological relationship, or lack the domain knowledge to determine how two <a>Spatial Things</a> are related, if at all. As the data publisher, you are likely to be in a better position to make these judgements than the user &mdash; so help them out by making these relationships clear.</p>

                  <p>Spatial relationships</p>
                  <p>Topological relationships between <a>Spatial Things</a> can be computed based on assessment of their <a>geometry</a>. [[GeoSPARQL]] defines families of topological relationships (based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM">DE-9IM</a> pattern) that, in mathematical terms, specify the spatial dimension of the intersections of the interiors, boundaries and exteriors of two geometric objects that may be 2-dimensional (e.g. area), 1-dimensional (e.g. linear) or 0-dimensional (e.g. point).</p>
                  <p>Most commonly used are the simple feature relationship family, described in [[SIMPLE-FEATURES]] section <span style="text-decoration: underline;">6.1.15.3 Named spatial relationship predicates based on the DE-9IM</span>. The set of seven named relationships, or <em>spatial predicates</em>, and their associated [[GeoSPARQL]] properties are listed below:</p>

                  <p>In addition to the mathematically precise spatial predicates described above, several vocabularies define similar relationships but without the formal mathematical underpinning. For example, [[SCHEMA-ORG]] defines a pair of basic containment relationships for use with <a href="http://schema.org/Place"><code>schema:Place</code></a>:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://schema.org/containsPlace"><code>schema:containsPlace</code></a>: <em>The basic containment relation between a place and another that it contains.</em></li>
                    <li><a href="http://schema.org/containedInPlace"><code>schema:containedInPlace</code></a>: <em>The basic containment relation between a place and one that contains it.</em></li>
                  </ul>
  
                  <p>It is also commonplace to use <a>spatial relationships</a> to convey distance (e.g. <em>at</em>, <em>nearby</em> or <em>far-away</em>) and direction (e.g. <em>left</em>, <em>inFrontOf</em>, <em>astern</em> and <em>below</em>). However, we find no evidence that points to use of common vocabularies to express these relationships -  perhaps because these relationships are often subjective and dependent on application context (e.g. the meaning of “near” will be quite different between an endurance cycling App and the App I use to find the Bluetooth tag attached to my house keys!).</p>
  
                  <p>Two notable examples of distance relations are:</p>

                  <p>This example snippet, adapted to use the GeoJSON [[RFC7946]] format, shows a list of <a>Spatial Things</a> (e.g. Westerkerk, Homomonument and Westertoren) that are deemed '<a href="http://sws.geonames.org/6618987/nearby.rdf">nearby</a>' Anne Frank's House according to <a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a>.</p>
  
                  <div class="note">
                    <p>The <a>JSON</a> [[RFC7159]] format provides only simple primitive types; string, number, boolean etc. The lack of a datatype for URIs means that they must be encoded as strings. As such, conventions (such as those defined in <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a>) are required to tell applications that a given string value is a URI. However, GeoJSON [[RFC7946]] does not define any conventions for describing URIs and forbids any extension of the data format specification.</p>
                    <p>To mitigate this, details about object types etc. included in data payload should be provided in the documentation for the API or service end-point from which the data is accessed. See [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#documentYourAPI">Best Practice 25: Provide complete documentation for your API</a> for further details.</p>

                  <p>Synonyms and equality</p>
                  <p>As described above, it is not uncommon for a <a>Spatial Thing</a> to be identified using more than one URI (also known as the "non-unique naming problem"). If you think that this is the case, the property <code>owl:sameAs</code> may be used to express this. However, caution is advised as <code>owl:sameAs</code> is an extremely strong statement; literally "these two URIs identify the same resource". As there is only <em>one</em> <a>Spatial Thing</a>, all the properties and attributes returned when resolving any of the equated URIs are considered to apply to that <a>Spatial Thing</a>. Given that spatial data is often published by different parties, each concerned with their own perspective, the <a>Spatial Thing</a> equality is often difficult to determine and depends heavily on the semantics involved.</p>
                  <p>So, the advice is: if in doubt, don't use <code>owl:sameAs</code>.</p>
  
                  <p>By way of example, let's explore some data for Edinburgh.</p> 
  
                  <p>The <em>City of Edinburgh Council Area</em> (e.g. the geographical area that Edinburgh City Council is responsible for) is identified by the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk">Office for National Statistics</a> (the recognized national statistical institute of the UK) using their GSS code (a 9 character alpha numeric identifier) <code>S12000036</code> and the URI <a href="http://statistics.data.gov.uk/id/statistical-geography/S12000036"><code>http://statistics.data.gov.uk/id/statistical-geography/S12000036</code></a>. At the same time, the devolved government in Scotland, operating under its own jurisdiction, retains the GSS code but uses the URI <a href="http://statistics.gov.scot/id/statistical-geography/S12000036"><code>http://statistics.gov.scot/id/statistical-geography/S12000036</code></a>. Furthermore, the <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk">Ordnance Survey</a> maintain yet another URI for the City of Edinburgh Council Area as part of its 'Boundary Line' service that contains administrative and statistical geography areas in the UK: <a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/7000000000030505"><code>http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/7000000000030505</code></a>. Similarly, Geonames identifies Edinburgh, a <em>second-order administrative division</em>, as <a href="http://sws.geonames.org/2650225/"><code>http://sws.geonames.org/2650225/</code></a>. All of these URIs refer to the same <a>Spatial Thing</a> and are equated using <code>owl:sameAs</code>.</p>

                  <p>Also note that in this [[TURTLE]] snippet one could easily include additional properties to help users determine whether the <a>link</a> is worth traversing, such as providing human-readable labels and specifying the <em>type</em> designated by each data publisher.</p>
  
                  <p>In contrast, the resource identified by <a href="http://data.os.uk/id/4000000074558316"><code>http://data.os.uk/id/4000000074558316</code></a> defines the <em>named place</em> Edinburgh - a colloquial definition for the city itself. This is not the same as the <em>City of Edinburgh Area</em> and therefore use of the <code>owl:sameAs</code> relationship is inappropriate.</p>
  
                  <div class="note">
                    <p>The mechanics of determining whether the information provided when resolving two or more URIs does indeed describe the same <a>Spatial Thing</a> is a complex topic all in its own right and way beyond the scope of best practice document. Tools such as <a href="http://openrefine.org">Open Refine</a> and the <a href="http://silkframework.org">Silk Linked Data Integration Framework</a> are designed to work with, transform and integrate heterogeneous data sources. Their documentation may provide further insight regarding these challenges.</p>
                  </div>

                  <p>Given the very strong semantics of the <code>owl:sameAs</code> property, alternative properties with weaker semantics are commonly used. Examples include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p><a href="https://schema.org/sameAs">schema:sameAs</a> defined by [[SCHEMA-ORG]] whose description states:</p>
                      <p style="margin-left: 40px"><em>URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Freebase page, or official website.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><a href="http://open.vocab.org/terms/similarTo">ov:similarTo</a> defined by <a href="http://vocab.org/open/">Open.vocab.org</a>, with the description:</p>
                      <p style="margin-left: 40px"><em>Having two things that are not the owl:sameAs but are similar to a certain extent. It is thought of being used where owl:sameAs is too strong but rdfs:seeAlso is too loose.</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/coreconcepts#terms_sameAs">http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/coreconcepts/sameAs</a>, defined by the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a>, whose description states that the property:</p>
                      <p style="margin-left: 40px"><em>Indicates that something is the same as something else, but in a way that is slightly weaker than owl:sameAs. Its purpose is to connect separate identities of the same thing, whilst keeping separation between the original statements of each.</em></p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>All of the properties list above, are concerned with equality or similarity about resources themselves. However, we often want to talk about the similarity of Spatial Things in terms of location or <em>place</em>. Spatial relations (see <a href="#link-type-spatial-rels" class="sectionRef">above</a>) can be used to describe how locations are related &mdash; either using rigorous topological relationships derived from geometry, such as <a href="http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#sfEquals"><code>geosparql:sfEquals</code></a>, or ones without formal mathematical underpinning, such as <a href="http://www.geonames.org/ontology#nearby"><code>geonames:nearby</code></a>. But <em>place</em> is a social concept that reflect how we humans perceive the space around us, often with a vague or imprecise notion of location; you can’t always define a boundary for a place like <a href="http://sws.geonames.org/2212709/">The Sahara</a> because not everyone agrees where its edge lies!</p>

                  <p>Talking of places, the <em>City of Edinburgh [Administrative] Area</em> and <em>Edinburgh</em> the <em>named place</em> are strongly related; you might say that they are the <em>same place</em> if that makes sense for your application. This also provides an example where it is worthwhile to provide multiple relationships between Spatial Things: Ordnance Survey uses the <a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/ontology/spatialrelations/within"><code>within</code></a> <a>link</a> relation type to relate the <em>named place</em> <a href="http://data.os.uk/id/4000000074558316">Edinburgh</a> and the <a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/id/7000000000030505">City of Edinburgh</a> administrative area. <a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/ontology/spatialrelations/within"><code>within</code></a> complements a qualitative <em>same-place-as</em> relation between two places.</p> 

                  <p>However, while we see people wanting to assert such qualitative <em>same-place-as</em> relationships based on human perception of place, there is no evidence of a best practice in how to achieve this; see <a href="#c-sameplaceas" class="sectionRef"></a> for more details about possible approaches that could be adopted.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Domain-specific relationships involving <a>Spatial Things</a></p>
  
                  <p>In addition to the <a>spatial relationships</a> that are applicable to a wide variety of domains, there are a huge number of cases where asserting a relationship between <a>Spatial Thing</a> is useful. Clearly, enumerating all these cases is more than we can do here - but we can look at some of those that commonly occur.</p>
  
                  <p>First, there are the properties used to describe relationships between <a>Spatial Things</a> in a <em>gazetteer</em>. These properties are often used in combination with spatial predicates to describe the relationship between administrative units. For example, <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk">Ordnance Survey</a> define specific properties to describe the relationships between the administrative units used within the UK: <a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/ontology/admingeo/county"><code>county</code></a>, <a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/ontology/admingeo/district"><code>district</code></a>, <a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/ontology/admingeo/ward"><code>ward</code></a>, etc.</p>

                  <p>A second domain where relationships between <a>Spatial Things</a> and non-spatial resources occur is earth observing. The example below, provided in [[GML]], relates a monitoring point at Deddington on the Nile River, Tasmania, to the sensor that is deployed there (using the <code>sams:hostedProcedure</code> property) and relates that monitoring point to the waterbody whose properties are being measured (using the <code>sam:sampledFeature</code> property).

                  <p>Our final example of a domain-specific relationship concerns creative works. For example, one may want to indicate the location a social media message was sent from. In the example below, we assume that Maurits, a tourist in Amsterdam, wants to comment on his visit to Anne Frank's House. His social media App uses the [[GEOLOCATION-API]] to determine his location (<code>Lat=52.37590</code> and <code>Long=4.88452</code>) and suggests several places that Maurits might choose from in order to geo-tag his message. Maurits wants people to know roughly where he is, so he chooses "Amsterdam-Centrum" and presses 'send'. The App encodes the message in [[SCHEMA-ORG]] and pushes the message to the server for distribution. The geo-information is provided using the <a href="http://schema.org/locationCreated"><code>schema:locationCreated</code></a> property.</p>

          <h4>Spatial data versioning</h4>
          <p><a>Spatial things</a> and their attributes can change over time. For example, a lake may grow or shrink due to changes in climate, water extraction or any number of reasons. For many applications, it is important that information about <a>Spatial Things</a> is kept up to date. When new information is available, the data publisher may make this available on the Web according to their update schedule and policies. [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#dataVersioning">section 8.6 Data Versioning</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#AccessUptoDate">Best Practice 21: Provide data up to date</a> provide directly applicable guidance.</p>
          
          <p>When dealing with change to a <a>Spatial Thing</a>, you should consider its lifecycle; in particular, how much change is acceptable before a Spatial Thing can no longer be considered as the same resource. Consider Eddystone Lighthouse for example: the “Eddystone Light”, a maritime navigation aid, has existed in (more or less) the same place on Eddystone Rocks since 1698. A single HTTP URI (such as <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eddystone_Lighthouse"><code>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eddystone_Lighthouse</code></a>) is used to identify “the lighthouse on Eddystone rocks” for all that period. The lighthouse's attributes (such as its focal height, visible range and light characteristic) have changed over that period, but we still consider it to be the same lighthouse. However, if our interest is historic buildings, we would identify the four different structures that have stood on that site as different Spatial Things, from Winstanley's Eddystone Lighthouse (the first incarnation) to Douglass' Eddystone Lighthouse (the 4th and current incarnation). In that context, incremental change for these structures during the entire period from 1698 is not appropriate; one structure replaces another and so each structure should be assigned a unique identifier. In summary, different things are important to different people!</p>
          
          <p>All that said, if you consider that the change affects the fundamental nature of the <a>Spatial Thing</a>, then you should assign a new identifier. See <a href="#bp-identifiers" class="sectionRef"></a> for more details. Otherwise, read on for guidance on how to describe properties that change over time.</p>

            <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
            <p><a>Spatial things</a> and their attributes change over time.  When it comes to <a>Spatial Things</a>, or <em>any</em> resource, that changes over time, it is important to provide metadata about the life cycle of those entities and the resources used to describe them. Given that information, data consumers can make considered choices about which resource they want to link to. Mostly, they are interested in current information. They need to be able to determine whether the published description of a Spatial Thing meets their needs. For example, is the published geographic <a>extent</a> of the City of Amsterdam relevant for a land-usage study of the nineteenth century? (<a href="http://www.gemeentegeschiedenis.nl">Gemeentegeschiedenis.nl</a>, "Municipality History", illustrates how the extent of Amsterdam has changed during the past 200-years, in <a href="http://www.gemeentegeschiedenis.nl/gemeentenaam/Amsterdam">HTML</a> and <a href="http://www.gemeentegeschiedenis.nl/gemeentenaam/json/Amsterdam">GeoJSON</a>). Where the information is available, a user may want to browse older versions of the published information to understand the nature of any changes or to find historical information.</p>

          <section class="outcome">
            <h4 class="subhead">Intended Outcome</h4>
            <p>Users are provided with the most recent version of information about a <a>Spatial Thing</a> and its attributes by default.</p>
            <p>Users can determine the time-period for which data is applicable.</p>
            <p>If a version history of changes is available, users can browse through a set of changes to see how a <a>Spatial Thing</a> and its attributes have changed over time.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
            
            <p>When publishing information about a <a>Spatial Thing</a> that is subject to change there are four approaches to consider in response to a change:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>simply updating the description of the Spatial Thing;</li>
              <li>republish the entire dataset with a new URI;</li>
              <li>providing a series of immutable snapshots that describe the Spatial Thing at various points in its lifecycle; and</li>
              <li>capturing a time-series of data values within an attribute of the Spatial Thing.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Whichever approach is chosen, publishers of <a>spatial data</a> should consider how dataset metadata plays an important part in helping users determine whether a dataset is fit for their use. Particularly where the contents of a dataset change with time, statements about the (most recent) publication date, the frequency of update and the time-period for which the dataset is relevant (i.e. temporal extent) should be provided. Please refer to [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#DescriptiveMetadata">section 8.2 Metadata</a> for more details about dataset metadata.</p> 
            
            <p>A description of the lifecycle of the <a>Spatial Things</a> (e.g. what triggers a change and whether those changes are versioned etc.) should also be provided in either the dataset's metadata, schema or specification. For example, the UK's Digital National Framework policy states that data publishers must provide these lifecycle rules.</p>
            
            <p>Approach (1) is lightweight and should only be used where there are no user requirements that require access to older descriptions of the <a>Spatial Things</a>. Data publishers simply replace the old description of the Spatial Thing with the amended description and keep users informed about updates by providing the appropriate metadata (e.g. when the data was changed). This may be achieved using dataset metadata (as outlined above) or by including the metadata attributes in the description of each Spatial Thing.</p>
            
            <p>Where users are anticipated to need to understand <em>how</em> a <a>Spatial Thing</a> has changed over time, approaches (2), (3) and (4) should be considered.</p>
            
            <p>Approach (2) is a simple variant on approach (1); the difference being that the entire dataset is assigned a new URI when changes are made, thereby enabling older versions of the dataset to be addressed separately. See [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#VersionIdentifiers">Best Practice 11: Assign URIs to dataset versions and series</a> for further details. Using this approach, a user should be able to compare two versions of the dataset to determine what has changed. Although simple for data publishers, the downside of this approach is that the effort is passed on to the users.</p>

            <p>Approach (3) requires the data publisher to publish immutable resources that describe the <a>Spatial Thing</a> at specific points in time (i.e. "snapshots") and provide a mechanism for users to browse between those snapshots. Effectively, the dataset becomes an accumulation of these snapshots that users can browse through. However, given that each snapshot of the Spatial Thing is published as a separate resource, this approach is suited to infrequent changes so that the number of snapshots does not become unwieldy.</p>
            
            <p>The URI for the <a>Spatial Thing</a>, the <em>base</em> URI, should dereference to provide the current information and a <a>link</a> to its version history of snapshots. [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#VersionHistory">Best Practice 8: Provide version history</a> describes how a version history may be implemented. Each snapshot resource within the version history must be uniquely identified; a common approach is to append a date/time stamp to the base URI as a version indicator. [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#VersioningInfo">Best Practice 7: Provide a version indicator</a> provides relevant guidance.</p>

            <p>Approach (4) is suitable where a <a>Spatial Thing</a> has a small number of attributes that are frequently updated. For example, the GPS-position of a runner or when streaming data from a sensor, such as the water level from a stream gauge.</p>
            
            <p>With this approach, the description of the <a>Spatial Thing</a> must include a property that contains a sequentially-ordered set of data-points, each of which defines a time-stamp and the values for the time-varying attribute(s). By definition, this property can be considered as a time-series <a>coverage</a>. Standard data encodings are available for time-series data, including: [[TIMESERIESML]] for [[GML]], plus [[COVERAGE-JSON]] and the <a>SensorThings</a> API [[SENSORTHINGS]] for <a>JSON</a> [[RFC7159]]. [[VOCAB-DATA-CUBE]] provides a generic mechanism to express well-structured data, such as time series, in <a>RDF</a> [[RDF11-PRIMER]]. Although not yet widely used enough to be considered <em>best practices</em>, [[EO-QB]] and [[QB4ST]] (developed alongside this best practice Note within the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">Spatial Data on the Web Working Group</a>) illustrate how [[VOCAB-DATA-CUBE]] may be used in this way.</p>
            
            <p class="note">The OGC [[MOVING-FEATURES-XML]] and [[MOVING-FEATURES-CSV]] specifications follow the pattern described above. A <code>trajectory</code> element is used to describe the position of a <a>Spatial Thing</a>, and varying attributes (such as orientation or rotation) can be added alongside the tuples in the trajectory. However, there is limited evidence of adoption outside of Japan.</p>

        <h3>Spatial data access</h3>
        <p>In recent years, we have seen widespread emergence of Web applications that use <a>spatial data</a>.
			 Often these applications do not access all the spatial data they use via the Web. While there 
			 are good reasons for this, e.g. licensing restrictions, it is often the case, too, that the
			 spatial data is not available via the Web at all, or in ways that application developers find
			 too complex to use, or with insufficient or unclear quality-of-service commitments.</p>
        <p>[[DWBP]] provides best practices discussing access to data using Web infrastructure (see [[DWBP]] <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#dataAccess">section 8.10 Data Access</a>). This
          section provides additional insight for publishers of <a>spatial data</a>. </p>
        <p>Making data available on the Web requires data publishers to provide some form of
          access to the data. There are numerous mechanisms available, each providing varying
          levels of utility and incurring differing levels of effort and cost to implement and
          maintain. Publishers of spatial data should make their data available on the Web using
          affordable mechanisms to ensure long-term, sustainable access to their
          data.</p>
        <p>When determining the mechanism to be used provide Web access to data, publishers need
          to assess utility against cost. In order of increasing usefulness and cost:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Bulk-download or streaming of the entire or pre-defined subsets of a dataset</li>
          <li>Generalized spatial data access API</li>
          <li>Bespoke API designed to support a particular type of use</li>
        </ol>
		  <p>Let's take a closer look at these options.</p>
        <p>The download of a dataset - or a pre-defined subset of it - via a single HTTP 
			 request is mainly covered by these [[DWBP]] best practices:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#BulkAccess">Best Practice 17: Provide bulk
            download</a>,</li>
          <li>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#ProvideSubsets">Best Practice 18: Provide 
            Subsets for Large Datasets</a>, and</li>
          <li>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#Conneg">Best Practice 19: Use content 
            negotiation for serving data available in multiple formats</a>.</li>
        </ul>
		  <p>Providing bulk-download or streaming access to data is useful in any case and
		    is relatively inexpensive to support as it relies on standard capabilities of Web servers 
		    for datasets that may be published as downloadable files stored on a server.
		    However, this option is more complex for frequently changing datasets or real-time data.</p>
		  <p>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#ProvideSubsets">Best Practice 18: 
		    Provide Subsets for Large Datasets</a> explains why providing subsets is important
		    and how this could be implemented. 
		    Spatial datasets, particularly <a>coverages</a> such as satellite imagery, sensor
		    measurement time-series and climate prediction data, are often very large. 
		    In these cases, it is useful to provide subsets by having identifiers for conveniently
		    sized subsets of large datasets that Web applications can work with.</p>
		  <p>Effectively, breaking up a large <a>coverage</a> into pre-defined lumps that you can 
		    access via HTTP GET requests is a <em>very simple</em> API.</p>
		  <p>When a subset is provided, this should include information about the relationship to the
		    complete dataset. In HTML, this could be descriptive text or it is implicitly clear for 
		    humans in the way the subset is presented. In [[SCHEMA-ORG]] it could be <a 
		      href="http://schema.org/isPartOf">schema:isPartOf</a> property. In <a>RDF</a> [[RDF11-PRIMER]], <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">PROV-O</a> could be used to describe the relationship
          between the subset and the complete dataset as well as the mechanism used to derive
			 the subset. In ISO 19115 metadata, the LI_Lineage element may be used for a similar 
			 purpose. Etc.</p>
		  <p>The use of APIs to access data is covered in [[DWBP]] by the following best practices:</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#useanAPI">Best Practice 23: Make data 
		      available through an API</a>,</li>
		    <li>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#APIHttpVerbs">Best Practice 24: Use Web 
		      Standards as the foundation of APIs</a>,</li>
		    <li>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#documentYourAPI">Best Practice 25: Provide 
		      complete documentation for your API</a>, and</li>
		    <li>[[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#avoidBreakingChangesAPI">Best Practice 26: 
		      Avoid Breaking Changes to Your API</a></li>
		  </ul>
        <p>For <a>spatial data</a>, <a>SDIs</a> have long been used to provide generalized access to 
          spatial data via Web services, typically using open standard specifications from the 
          <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> (OGC). 
          The main examples are <a>Web Feature Service</a> [[WFS]], <a>Web Coverage Service</a> [[WCS]], <a>Sensor 
          Observation Service</a>, <a>SensorThings</a> [[SENSORTHINGS]] or [[GeoSPARQL]] for access to data, or <a>Web Map Service</a> [[WMS]] 
          and <a>Web Map Tile Service</a> [[WMTS]] for access to data rendered as map. Apart from 
          the <a>Web Map Service</a>, the OGC standards have not seen widespread adoption 
          beyond the geospatial expert community.</p>
        <p>In addition, commercial offerings for publishing <a>spatial data</a> on the Web often provide
          access via product-specific APIs, too. These APIs are typically not restricted to 
          HTTP-based Web service APIs in the sense of [[DWBP]] <a 
            href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#APIHttpVerbs">Best Practice 24: Use Web Standards 
          as the foundation of APIs</a>, but include APIs targeted at a specific programming 
          language, for example, JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In the list of options above, a third option is included as sharing <a>spatial data</a>
          on the Web using the first two options (bulk download or generalized APIs) may not
          be sufficient for reaching application developers. Reasons for this include:</p>  
        <ul>  
          <li>Generalized spatial data access APIs, like the OGC standards, typically and 
            intentionally cover a wide range of usages, including requirements of users that 
            are geospatial experts, and they support a broad range of <a>Spatial Thing</a>s. While 
            they are documented comprehensively, they are often not easy to understand and 
            the "Time to First Successful Call" (see [[DWBP]] <a 
              href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#documentYourAPI">Best Practice 25: Provide 
            complete documentation for your API</a>) may be too high for application 
            developers. A typical convenience API is a simple API that implements complex requirements

            application developer.</li>
          <li>Spatial data as it is used by expert users may be complex. As users 
            need to understand how the data is structured to work effectively with 
            that data, this burdens the data user with significant effort before they 
            can even perform simple queries on data they have downloaded or access through 
            a generalized data access API.</li>
          <li>Spatial datasets tend to be large, often too large for direct use in Web 
            applications.</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>A useful 'bespoke API' mentioned in the third option provides convenience to 
        developers of the targeted applications, because the API designer has thought about 
        the needs of those developers when consuming the <a>spatial data</a> shared via the API.</p>

            <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
            <p>Providing access to <a>spatial data</a> via bulk download or generalized spatial 
              data access APIs may be too complex for application developers with 
              relatively simple requirements, if the spatial data or the API is complex 
              to understand or too large to handle in a Web application. 
              <strong>Convenience APIs</strong> are tailored to meet a specific goal;
              enabling a user to engage with complex data structures using (a set of)
              simple queries, including spatial search.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="outcome">
            <h4 class="subhead">Intended Outcome</h4>
            <p>The API provides a coherent set of queries and operations, including spatial 
              ones, that help users get working with the data quickly to achieve common tasks. 
              The API provides both machine readable data and human readable HTML markup.
              The human-readable markup will also support search engine's Web crawlers 
              to enable indexing of <a>spatial data</a>.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
            <p>The API should:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Offer <em>both</em> machine readable data and human readable HTML that includes 
                the structured metadata required by search engines seeking to index content
                (see <a href="#indexable-by-search-engines" class="sectionRef">Best 
                Practice 4: Make your entity-level data indexable by search engines</a> 
                for details);</li>
              <li>Follow the architectural guidance of the [[DWBP]] <a 
                href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#APIHttpVerbs">Best Practice 24: Use Web 
		          Standards as the foundation of APIs</a> and [[DWBP]] <a

                negotiation for serving data available in multiple formats</a>;</li>
              <li>Be well documented and easy to understand, both in terms of the options 
                to access / filter the data and of the data structures that are returned
                (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#documentYourAPI">Best 
                Practice 25: Provide complete documentation for your API</a>);</li>
              <li>Return data in chunks fit for use in Web applications and are useful sets
                of information.<br/>
                For large datasets, this is related to [[DWBP]] <a 
                href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#ProvideSubsets">Best Practice 18: Provide 
                Subsets for Large Datasets</a>; this may be achieved, for example, by 
                filtering options that return appropriately sized subsets of the specific 
                dataset or by supporting paging (returning larger subsets in pages with
                forward/backward <a>links</a>). For paging, some patterns have been established,
                see for example <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-paging/">W3C Linked 
                Data Platform Paging</a> or <a

                pagination</a>.</li>
              <li>For <a>geometries</a> with many coordinates, simplifying the geometries for display
                at large map scales - think about all administrative boundaries of Europe on a 
                map display with scale 1:30,000,000 - is another option; the simplification may be 
                controlled by the client using a query parameter indicating the target scale; <a>geometry</a>
                simplification including its caveats are discussed in <a href="#describe-geometry" 
                class="sectionRef">Best Practice 5: Provide geometries on the Web in a 
                usable way</a>.</li>
              <li>At the other end of the spectrum, overly small pieces of
                data are inconvenient to use, too. Data should be packaged in lumps that 
                are convenient to work with. An approach where very small, fine-grained 
                units of information are published that require further HTTP requests 
                to get the related information sufficient to determine context is not
                useful;</li>
              <li>Support queries for <a>Spatial Things</a> based on user needs. For <a>spatial data</a>, 
                typical needs that should be considered are neighborhood searches (e.g., 
                "what is near me?" or "what is near this Spatial Thing?") and searching for 
                things located in a specific area (e.g., an area shown as a map in an 
                application). Users will often look for a particular <a>Spatial Thing</a> without 
                knowing its identifier, too, in which case a fault-tolerant, free-text 
                search on the name, label or other property may be useful.</li>

            <p>In a White Paper about open geospatial APIs [[OGC-API-WP]], the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has defined the concept of the "OGC API Essentials" - a set of items defined in OGC standards and other open standards that are reusable modules for use in geospatial APIs. The White Paper provides <a href="http://docs.opengeospatial.org/wp/16-019r4/16-019r4.html#_ogc_api_essentials_initial_list">an initial list</a> and many of the identified standards are mentioned in this document. Reuse of standardized building blocks improves consistency and interoperability across APIs. It is recommended to consider the OGC API Essentials when defining an API to access <a>spatial data</a>.</p>

            <p>One such essential is a set of well-known spatial predicates for use in queries
              to select <a>Spatial Things</a> based on their <a>geometry</a>. Most commonly supported is 
              the following set: <em>equal</em>, <em>disjoint</em>, <em>touches</em>, 
              <em>within</em>, <em>overlaps</em>, <em>crosses</em>, <em>intersects</em>, 
              <em>contains</em>. These predicates were originally defined in [[SIMPLE-FEATURES]], 
				  but are also supported by [[GeoSPARQL]], <a>WFS</a> [[WFS]] and others. For more 
				  information about the definition of the predicates, see [[SIMPLE-FEATURES]].</p>
            <p></p>

            <p>If the data is already published in a <a>Spatial Data Infrastructure</a>, 
              there are basically two options to publish the data via an additional
              convenience API.</p>
            <ol>   
              <li>
              <p>Reuse your existing spatial data infrastructure</p>
              <p>Use a RESTful API as a wrapper, proxy or a shim layer can be created 
                around <a>SDI</a> services. This aims at exposing 'generalized APIs' using 
                'convenience APIs' to make the data easier to use. 
                For example, in the geospatial domain there are a 
                lot of <a>WFS</a> services providing <a>spatial data</a>. Content from the WFS 
                service can be provided in this way as <a>linked data</a>, <a>JSON</a> [[RFC7159]] or another
                Web friendly format using simple, navigable resources. 
                This approach is like the use of Z39.50 in 
                the library community; that protocol is still used but 'modern' Web sites 
                and Web services are wrapped around it.</p>
              <aside class="example">
                <p>An example of this approach of creating a convenience API that works 
                  dynamically on top of <a>WFS</a> is the experimental <a 
                  href="https://github.com/interactive-instruments/ldproxy">ldproxy</a>. 
                  This requires relatively little effort and is an attractive option for quickly 
                  exposing <a>spatial data</a> from existing WFS services on the Web. The approach is 
                  to create an intermediate layer by introducing a proxy on top of the 
                  WFS so the contained resources are made available. The proxy maps the 
                  data and metadata to [[SCHEMA-ORG]] according to a provided mapping scheme; 
                  assigns URIs to all resources based on a pattern; supports filtering 
                  based on a property; makes each resource available in HTML, <a>XML</a> [[XML11]], [[JSON-LD]], 
                  [[GML]], GeoJSON [[RFC7946]]; and generates <a>links</a> to data in other datasets managed in triple 
                  stores using <a>SPARQL</a> [[SPARQL11-OVERVIEW]] queries. The API is documented and published using 
                  Swagger.</p>
              </aside> 
              <aside class="example">
                <p>Mapping a URI template (as specified in [[RFC6570]]) to a <a>WFS</a>, <a>WCS</a> or <a
                    href="https://www.opendap.org/">OPeNDAP</a> end-point is a very simple
                  way of specifying a set of resources in the existing infrastructure.
                  This will not address all API aspects described in this best practice,
                  but it is a simple start.</p>
                <p>One advantage of this approach is to be able to hide
                  implementation details of the current backend in the URI. A Web service
                  URL in general does not provide a good URI for a resource as it is unlikely to be
                  persistent. A Web service URL is often technology and implementation dependent and
                  in practice both are likely to change with time.</p>
                <p>The <a href="#ex-elda">Environment Agency Bathing Water
                  Quality API</a> example above uses URI templates, too. In this case, 
                  the Linked Data API configuration uses URI templates to provide RESTful 
                  access to <a>SPARQL</a> queries thereby taking away from the user the challenge 
                  of writing generalized SPARQL queries and understanding the underpinning 
                  data model.</p>

              <p>A more effective route may be to provide an alternative 'Web friendly' 
                access path to the <a>spatial data</a> is to create a new, complementary service
                endpoint on top of the native storage of the dataset. This limits the 
                load on your <a>SDI</a> compared to the first option, which may matter as the 
                data access APIs of the SDI will continue to be used by expert users

        <h3>Spatial metadata</h3>
        <p>[[DWBP]] provides best practices discussing the provision of metadata to support
          discovery and reuse of data (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#metadata"
            >section 8.2 Metadata</a> for more details). Providing metadata at the <em>dataset</em> level
          supports a mode of discovery well aligned with the practices used in <a>Spatial Data
            Infrastructure</a> (SDI) where a user begins their search for <a>spatial data </a>by submitting
          a query to a catalog. Once the appropriate dataset has been located, the information
          provided by the catalog enables the user to find a service end-point from which to access
          the data itself - which may be as simple as providing a mechanism to download the entire
          dataset for local usage or may provide a rich API enabling the users to request only the
          required parts for their needs. The dataset-level metadata is used by the catalog to match
          the appropriate dataset(s) with the user's query.</p>
        <p>This section includes best practices for including the spatial <a>extent</a>, <a>CRS</a>, and other spatial details of the
          dataset in the metadata. These are the extra metadata items needed to make spatial
          datasets both discoverable and usable. A third best practice in this section goes a
          step further in granularity: exposing <a>spatial data</a> on the Web in such a way that individual entities or "granules"
          within a dataset can be discovered, evaluated, and utilized. </p>
        <p>Quality information is also an important part of spatial metadata, especially for asserting if data is fit for a certain purpose. [[DWBP]] provides a best practice discussing how the quality of data on the Web should be
          described (see [[DWBP]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#quality">section 8.5 Data Quality</a> for
          more details). This section is based on the Data Quality section from [[DWBP]] and adds a
          best practice specific for spatial data, which concentrates on the accuracy of the positions in the data
          - how close are they to the actual positions of the real world things?</p>
        <p>In the Spatial Metadata section, we provided a <a href="#bp-crs-choice" class="sectionRef">Best Practice</a> on how
          to deal with <a>CRS</a> in <a>spatial data</a> on the Web. There is also a clear link between CRS and
          data quality, because the accuracy of spatial data depends for a large part on the CRS
          used. This can be seen as conformance of data with a "standard" - in this case, a (spatial
          or temporal) reference system. This is how you can describe spatial data quality using
          different vocabularies. We will provide an example in this section. </p>
        <p>For some uses, it may be sufficient to simply state conformance to a published specification:</p>
        <pre class="example" id="ex-geodcat-ap-dataset-conformance-with-specification" title="GeoDCAT-AP specification of a dataset conformance with the INSPIRE Regulation on spatial data and services interoperability">a:Dataset a dcat:Dataset ;

&lt;<a href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2010/1089/oj">http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2010/1089/oj</a>&gt; a dcterms:Standard , foaf:Document ;
  dcterms:title "COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1089/2010 of 23 November 2010

             data sets and services"@en ;

          <section class="axioms">
            <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
            <p>Since location is such a powerful organizing principle, it is usually necessary to specifically describe the spatial details and nature of a
              dataset to discover it as well as to determine its fitness for use. This information is used, for example, by
                <a>SDI</a> catalog services that offer spatial querying to find data - but also by
              users to understand the nature of the dataset. In some cases, for example when dealing with crowd-sourced data, provenance information 
              or how the dataset came to be in its published form and with what quality, is important as well.</p>
            <p>The first level of spatial description is the spatial <a>extent</a> of the dataset,
              the area of the world that the dataset describes. This often suffices for initial discovery, but further levels of description are needed to evaluate a dataset for use.
              These include the dataset spatial coverage (continuity, resolution, properties) as well as the spatial representation or geometric model (for example, grid <a>coverage</a>,
              discrete coverage, point cloud, linear network).</p>
            <p>Dataset quality measures such as positional accuracy are also important for determining applicability. In the case
              of datasets whose spatial characteristics vary over their temporal coverage, spatial descriptions must include an explicit temporal aspect.</p>

            <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
            <p>When publishing a dataset, provide as much spatial metadata as necessary, but at least the spatial <a>extent</a>, coverage, and representation.
              Other examples of spatial metadata include: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>number of <a>dimensions</a> (1D, 2D, 3D, 4D)</li>
              <li>spatial representation type (e.g. grid, vector, text table)</li>
              <li>geometric property (e.g. boundary, bounding box, region, centerline, centroid, field) - expressed in the WGS 84 <a>coordinate reference system</a> to make the metadata consumable by as broad an audience as possible (see <a href="#bp-crs-choice" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 7: Choose coordinate reference systems to suit your user's applications</a> for more information).</li>
              <li>Coordinate Reference System(s) - refer to <a href="#CRS-background" class="sectionRef"></a> for an introduction to that topic</li>

              href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#DescriptiveMetadata">Best Practice 2: Provide descriptive metadata</a>:
                Include the spatial coverage of the things described by the dataset using
                [[VOCAB-DCAT]] and a reference to a named place in a common vocabulary for
                geospatial semantics (e.g. <a
                  href="http://www.geonames.org/ontology/documentation.html">GeoNames</a>).</li>
              <li>
                <p>Again, use [[VOCAB-DCAT]], but instead of a reference to a named place, use a set
                of coordinates to specify the boundaries of the area either as a bounding box
                or a polygon.</p>
                <p>This can be done, e.g., by using the approach defined in the spatial extension of

          <section class="axioms">
            <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
            <p>The amount of detail that is provided in <a>spatial data</a> and the resolution of the data
              can vary. No measurement system is infinitely precise and in some cases the spatial
              data can be intentionally generalized (e.g. merging entities, reducing the details,
              and aggregation of the data) [[Veregin]]. Some spatial data applications, such as aircraft navigation, require highly accurate data.
              For others, such as human navigation, a horizontal accuracy of a few meters is good enough.
              For yet others, such as overlaying weather forecasts on a map, the map is only giving a general indication of place.
              If the positional accuracy is published together with the data,
              the user can determine whether it is appropriate to use for their application.
              Potentially, this makes existing data more re-usable.</p>
            <p class="note">It is important to understand the difference between precision and
              accuracy. Seven decimal places of a <a>latitude</a> degree corresponds to about one
              centimeter. Whatever the precision of the specified coordinates, the accuracy of
              positioning on the actual earth's surface using WGS 84 will only approach about a meter
              horizontally and may have apparent errors of up to 100 meters vertically, because of
              assumptions about reference systems, tectonic plate movements and which definition of
              the earth's 'surface' is used.</p>

          <section class="outcome">
            <h4 class="subhead">Intended Outcome</h4>
            <p>For many uses, the positional accuracy of the data is an important aspect of assessing
              its fitness for purpose (quality).
              As with other data quality statements, this can be a quantitative measure, a statement 
              of conformance to a standard or policy, or an assertion or report of fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
            <p>Describe the accuracy of <a>spatial data</a> in a way that is understandable for humans. </p>
            <p>In addition, describe the accuracy of spatial data in a machine-readable format.
              [[VOCAB-DQV]] is such a format. It is a vocabulary for describing data quality, including
              the details of quality metrics and measurements. </p>
            <p>For observed (measured) datasets, it is possible to make specific quantitative statements
              about positional accuracy, based on knowledge of the equipment used to make the observations,
              and any processing carried out.</p> 
            <p>For <a>coverages</a>, the sampling distance is an effective way of indicating the amount of
              detail in the dataset - this is one of the meanings of the term "resolution".
              Alternatively, samples of the data could be independently checked against the real world, 
              and the results of that check reported.
              Either way, this is usually a statement of <a>absolute positional accuracy</a>, but for some uses, 
              relative positional accuracy is more important.</p>
            <p>Positional accuracy measurements, whether observed or asserted based on process,
              can be given using QualityMeasurement.</p>
            <p>For modelled datasets, for example in planning and construction, there is no 'real world' against
              which to assess the positional accuracy - but relative positional accuracy can still be stated.</p>
            <p>For many uses, a statement of the amount of detail provided is sufficient to assess fitness for purpose; 
              examples include "level of detail" (building models), "navigational purpose" (marine navigation),
              "equivalent scale" or "zoom level" (cartography).
              Sometimes, this is expressed as if it were a statement of positional accuracy.</p>
            <p>These can be expressed in the same way as for non-spatial data; for example using the <code>QualityAnnotation</code>,
              <code>Standard</code>, and <code>QualityPolicy</code> statements of [[VOCAB-DQV]].</p>

      <h2>Gaps in current practice</h2>
      <p>The best practices described in the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practice are compiled based on evidence of real-world application, as described in <a href="#best-practice-criteria" class="sectionRef"></a>. However, there are several issues that inhibit the use or interoperability of <a>spatial data</a> on the Web, for which no evidence of real-world applied solutions is available. These issues are denoted “gaps in current practice”. In the case of gaps, there might be emerging practice i.e. a solution that has been theorized for a certain issue and has possibly been experimented on in beta settings, but not in production environments. Gaps and emerging practices in the area of publishing spatial data on the Web are discussed in this section. 
      </p>
      <section id="c-geometrycrs">
        <h3>Requesting different representations of geometries</h3>
        <p>There are several aspects to representing <a>geometries</a> on the Web. First, there is the question of different serialization formats to choose from. The different formats are described in <a href="#describe-geometry" class="sectionRef"></a>, but the Best Practice does not make a definitive choice as to which format is best. Although having only one format for geometries on the Web would reduce complexity, the currently available formats reflect different requirements with respect to data complexity and manipulation.  </p>
        <p>A second, related aspect is whether to publish <a>geometries</a> on the Web in self-contained files such as [[GML]] or GeoJSON [[RFC7946]], or rather to embed geometries as structured data markup in HTML, or in an <a>RDF</a> [[RDF11-PRIMER]] based way i.e. as <a>Linked Data</a>. Choosing between these approaches - or not choosing but rather offering a combination of these - depends largely on the intended audience.</p>
        
        <p>Another issue is about the fact that different use cases may require geometries at different levels of accuracy, precision, and size. <a href="#multiplegeometries" class="sectionRef"></a> outlines some of the approaches to address this requirement, considering general application scenarios and providing guidance on the criteria to be taken into account for choosing the appropriate technique (e.g., compress geometry data, use compact formats, apply geometry generalization mechanisms). The overall recommendation is to make available multiple representations of geometry data, and to give data consumers the ability to identify those most fit for purpose. A variety of mechanisms can be used to achieve this, as publishing different geometry representations at different URIs, and accompanying them with a human- and/or machine-readable description of their characteristics (e.g., format, spatial resolution, scale, level of generalization). However, the lack of common practices in this area makes it difficult to provide consistent guidelines on how to publish and access different geometry representations.</p>        
        
        <p>Finally, there is a question of how to make <a>geometries</a> available in different <a>CRS</a>s. <a href="#bp-crs-choice" class="sectionRef"></a> describes why this is a good idea as well as how to decide which CRSs to provide. <a href="#bp-crs" class="sectionRef"></a> explains how the CRS of geometries should be made known. It follows that users should be able to find out which CRSs are available and access geometries in the CRS of their choice. In an OGC <a>WFS</a> [[WFS]] request, users can specify the CRS they wish to use by specifying the srsName parameter. In [[GeoSPARQL]] the getSRID function returns the spatial reference system of a <a>geometry</a>, thus making it possible to request a specific CRS at a (Geo)SPARQL endpoint. However, these options require the user to be proficient in either Geospatial Web services or <a>Linked Data</a>. A best practice for requesting and returning geometries in a specific requested CRS has not yet emerged. Many options can be found in current practice, including  creating CRS-specific geometry properties (for example, the Dutch Land Registry does this), and supporting an option for requesting a specific CRS in a convenience API; but one best practice cannot yet be identified. </p>
        <p>An option we considered was the use of content negotiation i.e. negotiate <a>CRS</a> as part of the content format for the geometry. A <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sdw/issues/757">concrete proposal</a> for this suggests the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Servers can tell clients which CRS is used in the response using a new Content-Crs response header.</li>
          <li>clients can tell servers which CRS is used in the request using a new Content-Crs request header.</li>
          <li>clients can tell servers which CRS is preferred in the response using a new Accept-Crs request header.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, providing different <a>CRS</a> might be too complicated to handle in the HTTP protocol. For example, multidimensional datasets will in general use multiple CRSs (e.g. horizontal, vertical and temporal, maybe more), and conversion between CRSs will in general introduce errors, so data in one CRS are not exactly the same as data in another CRS. It might therefore be more appropriate to handle this in the application layer. Generally, choosing among various parameters options of data objects such as <a>geometries</a> would be an overloading of HTTP content negotiation protocols. </p>
        <aside class="note">
          <p>On a more general level, content negotiation (as recommended in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/#Conneg">DWBP Best Practice 19: Use content negotiation for serving data available in multiple formats</a>)  could be expanded to enable its use for choosing a 'profile' concerning the semantics and structure of the data, such as a data vocabulary. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/charter">Dataset Exchange WG (DXWG)</a> aspire to provide a REC for "content negotiation by profile" (see also [[RFC6906]] "profile" Link Relation Type).</p>

        <h3>Spatial data vocabulary</h3>
        <p>Although a large amount of <a>spatial data</a> has been published on the Web,  so far there are few authoritative datasets containing geometrical descriptions of their boundaries. Their number is growing (e.g. at the time of writing there are three authoritative spatial datasets publicly available as <a>linked data</a> in the Netherlands containing topographic, cadastral, and address data), but currently there is no common practice in the sense of the same spatial vocabulary being used by most spatial data publishers. Direct georeferencing of data implies representing coordinates or <a>geometries</a> and associating them to a <a>CRS</a>. This requires vocabularies for geometries and CRSs. The consequence is the lack of a baseline during the mapping process for application developers trying to consume specific incoming data. Datasets describing administrative units, points of interest or postal addresses with their labels and geometries, and identifying these <a>Spatial Things</a> with URIs could be beneficial not only for georeferencing other datasets, but also for interlinking datasets georeferenced by direct and indirect location information. </p>
        <p>Currently, no single standardized vocabulary is available that covers all needs. A possible way forward is an update for the [[GeoSPARQL]] spatial ontology. This will provide an agreed spatial ontology, i.e. a bridge or common ground between geographical and non-geographical <a>spatial data</a> and between W3C and OGC standards; conformant to the [[ISO-19107]] abstract model and based on existing available ontologies such as [[GeoSPARQL]], the [[W3C-BASIC-GEO]] vocabulary, [[NeoGeo]] and the ISA Programme Location Core Vocabulary [[LOCN]]. </p>
        <p>This vocabulary would define basic semantics for the concept of a reference system for spatial coordinates, a basic datatype, or basic datatypes for <a>geometry</a>, how geometry and real world objects are related and how different versions of <a>geometries</a> for a single real world object can be distinguished. For example, it makes sense to publish different geometric representations of a spatial object that can be used for different purposes. The same object could be modelled as a point, a 2D polygon or a 3D polygon. The polygons could have different versions with different resolutions (generalization levels). And all those different geometries could be published with different <a>coordinate reference systems</a>. Thus, the vocabulary would provide a foundation for harmonization of the many different geometry encodings that exist today.</p>

        <h3>Describing dataset structure and service behaviors</h3>
        <p>Even if all <a>spatial data</a> should become findable directly through search engines, data portals would still remain important hubs for data discovery - for example, because the metadata records registered there can be made crawlable. But in addition, different data portals can harvest each other's information provided there is consistency in the types and meaning of included information, even if structures and technologies vary. In the eGovernment sector, [[VOCAB-DCAT]] is a standard for dataset metadata publication and harvesting implemented by these portals. Because it is lacking in possibilities for describing some specific characteristics spatial datasets, an application profile for <a>spatial data</a>, [[GeoDCAT-AP]], has been developed in the framework of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/">ISA Programme of the European Union</a>, with the primary purpose of enabling the sharing of spatial metadata across domains and catalogue platforms. [[GeoDCAT-AP]] is mentioned in the "Possible approach" section of several Best Practices in this document. </p>
          <p>With the goal of sharing spatial metadata, [[GeoDCAT-AP]] defined <a>RDF</a> bindings covering the core profile of [[ISO-19115]] and the INSPIRE metadata schema [[INSPIRE-MD]], enabling the harmonized <a>RDF</a> representation of existing spatial metadata. The reason of this choice was to focus first on the most used metadata elements, whereas additional mappings could be defined in future versions of the specification, based on users’ and implementation feedback.</p>
         <p>The next step is evolution towards a single standard for metadata as it is used in data portals, without loss of relevant metadata, while still understandable and not too complicated. A working group in the Open Geospatial Consortium is currently working on this.</p>

        <h3>Publishing dynamic and large datasets on the Web</h3>
        <p>Large and complex datasets, for example data gathered using automated sensors, may be impossible to download in its entirety due to its dynamic nature and potential volumes. It is therefore necessary in these cases to be able to adequately describe the structure of such data and how services interact to expose subsets of it - even individual records in a Linked Data context. Currently, there is no established Best Practice for dealing with this, especially when taking the spatial and temporal dimensions into account.</p>
        <p>Large, complex datasets are common in the information processing world, and commonly organized in “hypercubes” - where “data dimensions” are used to locate values holding results. A standard based on this dimensional model of data  is the RDF Data Cube vocabulary [[VOCAB-DATA-CUBE]]. It has been used to publish sensor data, but RDF Data Cube is lacking in possibilities for describing spatio-temporal aspects of data, which are very important for observations. One of the work items in the Spatial Data on the Web working group has been to extend the existing RDF Data Cube ontology to support specification of key metadata required to interpret spatio-temporal data, called [[QB4ST]].</p> 
        <p>QB4ST is an extension to RDF Data Cube  to provide mechanisms for defining spatio-temporal aspects of dimension and measure descriptions. It is intended to enable the development of semantic descriptions of specific spatio-temporal data elements by appropriate communities of interest, rather than to enumerate a static list of such definitions. It provides a minimal ontology of spatio-temporal properties and defines abstract classes for data cube components (i.e. dimensions and measures) that use these, to allow classification and discovery of specialized component definitions using general terms.</p>
        <p>QB4ST is designed to support the publication of consistently described re-usable and comparable definitions of spatial and temporal data elements by appropriate communities of practice. One obvious such case is the use of GPS coordinates described as decimal <a>latitude</a> and <a>longitude</a> measures. Another example is the intended publication of a register of <a>Discrete Global Grid Systems</a> (DGGS) by the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/dggsswg">OGC DGGS Working Group</a>. QB4ST is intended to support publication of descriptions of such data using a common set of attributes that can be attached to a property description (extending the available RDF-QB mechanisms for attributes of observations).</p>

        <h3>Helping software understand units of measure</h3>
        <p>Spatial data is often concerned with measurements (distance, angles etc.) &mdash; for example, when specifying the position of a feature according to a <a>Coordinate Reference System</a> or the accuracy of that position.</p>

        <p>For measurement values to be correctly interpreted, a <em>unit of measurement</em> must also be specified. The challenge here is specifying units of measurement in a way that can be widely understood.</p>

        <p>As humans, we’re usually quite good at guessing. For example, given a discussion about the accuracy of a position, the assertion <code>&plusmn;3.1 m</code> probably means 3.1 <em>meters</em>. That seems reasonable &mdash; but it might also be 3.1 <em>miles</em>. Unfortunately, software systems mostly lack the human ability to guess. So we need to unambiguously express which unit of measure is being used &mdash; and this is where the problems exist.</p>

        <p>There are essentially two mechanisms that can be used:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Use a named serialization scheme that provides string-literal notation for both base units and derived units. Given that there are an infinite number of derived units, such a serialization should specify a formal grammar that software applications use to interpret those strings; enabling automated conversion between units and other useful functions like verifying that two measured quantities can be combined based on the dimensionality of those measurements (e.g. you can’t combine a length with an area and get a sensible answer!).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Use a URI; such as those provided by <a href="http://www.qudt.org/release2/qudt-catalog.html">Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types Ontologies (QUDT)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HajoRijgersberg/OM/blob/master/README.md">Ontology of units of Measure (OM)</a>. For example, the unit of measure <em>meter</em> has the URIs <code>http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/M</code> and <code>http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/metre</code>.</p>
          </li>
        </ol> 

        <p>Earlier versions of [[GML]] required that every unit was specified using a URI. But, in practice, many were using symbols like "<code>m</code>" instead of a URI anyway, as they are shorter and often better understood. As a result, [[GML]] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">clause 8.2.3.6 MeasureType, UomIdentifier</span> now allows the <a href="http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html">Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM)</a> unit of measure serialization in addition to URIs.</p>

        <p>If you choose to use a serialization scheme for expressing units of measure, you should select one that is well-known among your community of users.</p>

        <p>It’s also worth noting that, if your format or vocabulary allows, you should include a human readable label. For the simple case of displaying the data on a Web page, this removes the need to look up this information from the serialization scheme specification or vocabulary.</p>

        <p>The trouble with the use of serialization schemes is that we can’t assume client applications understand the notation. We need some mechanism to indicate which serialization is being used &mdash; either so that application developers can find the specification and source some software (e.g. the <a href="https://github.com/jmandel/ucum.js">ucum.js</a> library) to process the unit strings, or so that the client application can map the notation to a well-known URI whose definition conforms to a data model that the application can understand.</p>

        <p>There is no evidence of best practice here &mdash; nor is there consensus on which data model is best for describing units of measure. Possible approaches to identify the serialization scheme used include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Provide this information in the data itself, e.g. </p>

          </li>
        </ul>  

        <p>In summary, if you think that your users will need to support automated processing of units of measure, then, in lieu of widespread best practice, it will likely be worth engaging with your user community to determine how best to meet their needs.</p>

        <p>Looking to the future, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/"><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Web of Things Interest Group</a> has created a task force to address the challenges of semantic interoperability relating to units of measure, which may lead to emergence of best practices can be adopted by spatial data publishers.</p>

        <h3>Defining that two places are the same</h3>
        <p>Unlike administrative areas and other topographic features that have clearly defined boundaries, places often have ill-defined, fuzzy boundaries that are based on human perception of ‘place’; you can’t always define a boundary for a place. For example, <a href="http://data.os.uk/id/4000000074558316">Edinburgh</a> the <em>named place</em>, published by <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/">Ordnance Survey</a>, is described using only a notional point <a>geometry</a>; information is not provided about the geometric <a>extent</a>. Other examples of places with ill-defined, fuzzy <a>geometries</a> include <a href="http://sws.geonames.org/2212709/"><em>The Sahara</em></a>, the <em>American West</em> and <em>Renaissance Italy</em>. The relationships between places, with their ill-defined (or even absent) geometrical extents, defy description using the topological relationships which are computed mathematically from geometry.</p> 

        <p>Given the lack of existing best practice, we propose the use of a <em>qualitative</em> assertion based on human perceptions to relate places that are deemed to be the same: <strong>samePlaceAs</strong>.</p> 

        <p>Given that the notion of <em>place</em> concerns a social perspective, we consider it to be distinct from <em>location</em> which is based on <a>geometry</a>. As a result, <code>samePlaceAs</code> can be used to assert the imprecise, social perceptions about the equality of places. <code>samePlaceAs</code> does not overlap with the topological relationships described later in this best practice document that can be computed from geometry.</p>
  
        <p>As with all assertions of an imprecise nature that lack formal semantics, <code>samePlaceAs</code> may have limited value for semantic reasoning. Exactly what constitutes the ‘same place’ will always be somewhat debatable. For example, is <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Byzantium">ancient Byzantium</a> the same place as <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Istanbul">modern Istanbul</a>? Is a historical hotel that was moved across the street to save it from demolition in a redevelopment scheme that same place that it used to be?</p>

        <p>[[SCHEMA-ORG]] would be a good home for this link relation type. The definition would be something as follows:</p>
  
        <div style="margin-left: 40px">
          <p><a href="http://schema.org/Thing"><code>Thing</code></a> &gt; <a href="http://schema.org/Property"><code>Property</code></a> &gt; <code>samePlaceAs</code></p>
          <p>Used to relate two places that are perceived to be the same; the physical <a>extent</a> of the two places should be broadly comparable but do not need to be equal in a topological or geometric sense.</p>
          <p><strong>Values expected to be one of these types:</strong> <a href="http://schema.org/Place"><code>Place</code></a></p>
          <p><strong>Used on these types:</strong> <a href="http://schema.org/Place"><code>Place</code></a></p>
        </div>

        <p>However, the current definition of <a href="http://schema.org/Place"><code>schema:Place</code></a> is a little too general:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px"><em>Entities that have a somewhat fixed, physical extension.</em></p>
        <p>This definition includes <em>anything</em> with spatial extent (i.e. all <a>Spatial Things</a>); we would consider "my car keys" to be a Spatial Thing, but not a place.</p>
        <p>A continuation of the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">SDW WG</a> intends to formally define <code>samePlaceAs</code>.</p>

        <h3>Discovering what refers <em>to</em> a Spatial Thing</h3>
        <p><a>Links</a> by their nature are a directional relationship between source and target. Most often, a link is published within the dataset that describes the source resource specified in the link, enabling users to browse through information; traversing the links they find in documents (i.e. <em>outbound</em> links). While many links specify source and target resources that are described in the same dataset, it is commonplace, and encouraged as per the 5&#9733; rating, to link <em>between</em> datasets, thereby 'stitching' together the Web of data. In these situations, a link refers to some remote target resource. A dataset access API may interpret such links to enable a user to specify a well-known URI of a <a>Spatial Thing</a> they are interested in (for example from popular data repositories such as <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">GeoNames</a>, <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a> or <a href="http://dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>) in order to search for related information (see <a href="#convenience-apis" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 12: Expose spatial data through 'convenience APIs'</a> for more on APIs and search). But how does a user know of the existence of a link referring <em>to</em> their target Spatial Thing (and potentially identifying a related resource that is useful for their intended goal) when that link is published within a remote dataset resource (i.e. an <em>inbound</em> link)?</p>
        <p>Making these inbound <a>links</a> discoverable makes the Web of data symmetric; e.g. where both inbound and outbound links are visible to data users who may then choose to traverse them. However, links provide a secondary benefit in terms of a citation; indicating some subjective trustworthiness of the data (e.g. "it's good enough quality for me to use"). Not only do such link-based citations convey the value of the dataset in a way that the original publisher can objectively quantify (and hence continue to publish and maintain those datasets), but they can provide a subjective indication of quality; like a search engine’s page ranking algorithm, the larger the number of sources of inbound links, the greater the likelihood that a given dataset is of high quality.</p>
        <p>Search engines play an important role in the Web ecosystem; if <a>spatial data</a> is published in a way that is indexable by search engines (see <a href="#indexable-by-search-engines" class="sectionRef">Best Practice 2: Make your spatial data indexable by search engines</a>) then it should be possible to find the relationships between <a>Spatial Things</a>. However, the internals of search engines are opaque to most users, and the necessary query-patterns may not be offered.</p>
        <p>An alternative is to publish or harvest <a>links</a> into a common repository that can be queried. For example, the <a href="http://sameas.org">&lt;sameAs&gt;</a> service exposes a collection of links defined using the <code>owl:sameAs</code> relation type that can be queried to find related resources. As an illustration, the HTTP GET request <a href="http://sameas.org/store/freebase/n3?uri=%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Frdf.freebase.com%2Fns%2Fm.02s5hd%3E"><code>http://sameas.org/store/freebase/n3?uri=&lt;http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.02s5hd&gt;</code></a> finds four matches, all of which identify Anne Frank's House. The problem with this ad-hoc approach is that a client application would need to be configured to query an arbitrary number of known service end-points to discover <a>links</a> published across all the domains deemed of interest. As such, this kind of approach is only likely to be useful where one can alert the user community which services they should refer to.</p>
        <p>Publishing summary information about datasets and the <a>links</a> defined in them using the Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets [[VoID]] may provide a workable approach &mdash; but is yet to be widely adopted.</p>
        <p>In [[VoID]], <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/void/#linkset" class="externalDFN">Linksets</a> provide summary description of the relationships between two datasets; identifying the source and target datasets, the link relation type(s) used plus optional metadata such as URI templates for identifying participating resources and the number of <a>links</a> specified for each relation type, and may describe <em>technical features</em> such as APIs through which the participating datasets can be accessed.</p>
        <p>Applications could be configured to harvest [[VoID]] descriptions from data publishers in their community, enabling them to build a searchable graph of relationships between datasets &mdash; a <em>Data Network</em>. Because this information is summarized at the set level, the data network graph is convenient to work with, allowing simple discovery of numbers and relation types of both <em>inbound</em> and <em>outbound</em> <a>links</a> within a given dataset. Once the presence of interesting links within a dataset has been identified, the user would then work directly with the dataset in question (or the API through which it is accessed) to acquire the detailed information about specific links defined in that dataset.</p>
        <p>Interactions such as those described above would be quite intensive for a human using a browser. However, the [[VoID]] descriptions could be used to drive a software agent that hides much of the complexity from the user; for example, automatically harvesting individual <a>links</a> once a set-level relationship is considered interesting, and then allowing the user to traverse those links either forwards or backwards.</p>

    <section class="appendix" id="glossary">
      <h2>Glossary</h2>
      <p><dfn>Absolute positional accuracy</dfn>: The closeness of reported coordinate values to values accepted as or being true [[ISO-19159-2]].</p>
      <p><dfn>Axis order</dfn>: The order in which coordinates are presented. For example, some systems use (latitude, longitude) rather than (longitude, latitude). The latter is more similar to the mathematical convention of (x, y) ordering. The order used may differ from the order used to define the coordinate system.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="CRS|Coordinate Reference System|Coordinate Reference Systems">Coordinate Reference System (CRS)</dfn>: A coordinate system to locate entities of interest with respect to an object using a <a>datum</a>  [[ISO-19111]]. If the entities of interest and the object and datum are in the real world, the CRS is a <em>Spatial Reference System</em> (SRS). If the object is the Earth, the SRS is a <em>Geo-Spatial Reference System</em> (GRS). A GRS may be local, regional or global in scope. An example of a CRS that is not a SRS is the wavelength of a signal in the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Coverage|Coverages|Coverage Function">Coverage</dfn>: A coverage is a function that describe characteristics of real-world phenomena that vary over space and/or time. Typical examples are temperature, elevation and precipitation. A coverage is typically represented as a data structure containing a set of such values, each associated with one of the elements in a spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal domain. Typical spatial domains are point sets (e.g. sensor locations), curve sets (e.g. contour lines), grids (e.g. orthoimages, elevation models), etc. A property whose value varies as a function of time may be represented as a temporal coverage or time-series [[ISO-19109]].</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="CSV|Comma Separated Values|Tabular Data">Comma Separate Values (CSV)</dfn>: A file format for tabular data that writes each row on a separate line and each cell is separated from the next with a comma; see [[RFC4180]]. CSV is just one variety of tabular data; for more information refer to [[TABULAR-DATA-PRIMER]].</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="datum|datums">Datum</dfn>: Parameter or set of parameters that define the position of the origin, the scale, and the orientation of a coordinate system [[ISO-19111]].</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="dimension|dimensions|dimensional|dimensionality">Dimension (geometry)</dfn>: In physics and mathematics, the dimension of a mathematical space (or object) is informally  defined (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dimension&oldid=775064678">Wikipedia entry</a>) as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it. Thus, a point has no dimension (0D) as there is no inside, whereas a line has a dimension of one (1D) because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point along it – for example, the point at 5 on a number line. A surface such as a plane or the surface of a cylinder, torus or sphere has a dimension of two (2D) because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it – for example, both a <a>latitude</a> and <a>longitude</a> are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. The inside of a cube, cylinder, torus or sphere is three-dimensional (3D) because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces. For a formal rigorous mathematical definition see the ISO definition  [[ISO-19107]].</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Discrete Global Grid System|Discrete Global Grid Systems|DGGS">Discrete Global Grid System</dfn>: A DGGS is a form of Earth reference that, unlike its established counterpart the <a>coordinate reference system</a> that represents the Earth as a continual lattice of points, represents the Earth with a tessellation of nested cells. Generally, a DGGS will exhaustively partition the globe in closely packed hierarchical tessellations, each cell representing a homogenous value, with a unique identifier or indexing that allows for linear ordering, parent-child operations, and nearest neighbour algebraic operations.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="ellipsoid|ellipsoids">Ellipsoid</dfn>: An ellipsoid is a closed quadric surface that is a three-dimensional analogue of an ellipse. In <em>geodesy</em>, a <strong>reference ellipsoid</strong> is a mathematically defined surface that approximates the <a>geoid</a>.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Extensible Markup Language|XML">Extensible Markup Language (XML)</dfn>: A simple, very flexible text-based markup language derived from SGML (ISO 8879). It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable [[XML11]].</p>
      <p><dfn>Extent</dfn>: The area covered by something. Within this document, we always imply spatial extent; e.g. size or shape that may be expresses using coordinates. </p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="feature|features">Feature</dfn>: Abstraction of real world phenomena. A digital representation of a real world entity or an abstraction of the real world. Examples of features include almost anything that can be placed in time and space, including desks, buildings, cities, trees, forest stands, ecosystems, delivery vehicles, snow removal routes, oil wells, oil pipelines, oil spill, and so on. The terms feature and object are often used synonymously [[ISO-19101]].</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Geocoding|Forward geocoding|reverse geocoding">Geocoding</dfn>: Forward geocoding, often just referred to as geocoding, is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates. Reverse geocoding is the opposite process; converting geographic coordinates to addresses. See also the ISO definition [[ISO-19133]].</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Geographic information|Geospatial data">Geographic information (also geospatial data)</dfn>: Information concerning phenomena implicitly or explicitly associated with a location relative to the Earth.  [[ISO-19101]].</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Geographic information system|GIS">Geographic information system (GIS)</dfn>: An information system dealing with information concerning phenomena associated with locations relative to the Earth.  [[ISO-19101]].</p>
      <p><dfn>Geohash</dfn>: A specific <a>geocoding</a> system with a hierarchical spatial data structure which subdivides space into nested regions. Geohashes and some other geocoding systems offer properties like arbitrary precision and the possibility of repeatedly truncating characters from the end of the code to reduce its size and precision. As a consequence of the gradual precision degradation, nearby places will often (but not always) present similar prefixes. The longer a shared prefix is, the closer the two places are. Coordinate and address systems generally do not have this property. (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geohash&oldid=773644736">wikipedia</a>). </p>
      <p><dfn>Geoid</dfn>: An equipotential surface where the gravitational field of the Earth has the same value at all locations. This surface is perpendicular to a plumb line at all points on the Earth's surface and is roughly equivalent to the mean sea level excluding the effects of winds and permanent currents such as the Gulf Stream.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="geometry|geometries">Geometry</dfn>: An ordered set of <var>n</var>-<a>dimensional</a> points in a given <a>coordinate reference system</a>; can be used to model the spatial <a>extent</a> or shape of a <a>Spatial Thing</a>.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="IoT|Internet of Things">Internet of Things (IoT)</dfn>: The network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to be controlled remotely and to collect and exchange data.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="JavaScript Object Notation|JSON">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</dfn>: A lightweight, text-based, language-independent data interchange format defined in [[RFC7159]]. It was derived from the ECMAScript Programming Language Standard. JSON defines a small set of formatting rules for the portable representation of structured data.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="latitude|lat|latitudes">Latitude</dfn>: The angular distance north or south of the equator. Often abbreviated to <em>Lat</em>.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="link|links">Link</dfn>: A typed connection between two resources that are identified by Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [[RFC3987]], and is comprised of: (i) a context IRI, (ii) a link relation type, (iii) a target IRI, and (iv) optionally, target attributes. Note that in the common case, the IRI will also be a URI [[RFC3986]], because many protocols (such as HTTP) do not support dereferencing IRIs [[RFC5988]].</p>
      <p><dfn>Linked data</dfn>: The term ‘Linked Data’ refers to an approach to publishing data that puts linking at the heart of the notion of data, and uses the linking technologies provided by the Web to enable the weaving of a global distributed database [[LDP-PRIMER]].</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="longitude|long|lon">Longitude</dfn>: The angular distance east or west of the prime meridian. Often abbreviated to <em>Long</em>.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="map projection|map projections">Map Projection</dfn>: A coordinate conversion from an ellipsoidal coordinate system to a plane, e.g. Transverse Mercator.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Open-world assumption|open world assumption|OWA">Open-world assumption (OWA)</dfn>: In a formal system of logic used for knowledge representation, the open-world assumption asserts that the truth value of a statement may be true irrespective of whether or not it is known to be true. This assumption codifies the informal notion that in general no single agent or observer has complete knowledge. In essence, from the absence of a statement alone, a deductive reasoner cannot (and must not) infer that the statement is false. That is, a valid response to a logical query may be: true, false or unknown.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Projected CRS|Projected Coordinate Reference Systems">Projected Coordinate Reference System</dfn>: A <a>coordinate reference system</a> derived from a two-dimensional geodetic coordinate reference system by applying a <a>map projection</a>.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Resource description framework|RDF">Resource Description Framework (RDF)</dfn>: A directed, labeled graph data model for representing information in the Web. It may be serialized in several data formats such as N-Triples [[N-TRIPLES]], XML [[RDF-SYNTAX-GRAMMAR]], Terse Triple Language (“turtle” or TTL) [[TURTLE]] and [[JSON-LD]].</p>
      <p><dfn>Semantic Web</dfn>: The term “Semantic Web” refers to World Wide Web Consortium's vision of the Web of <a>linked data</a>. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on the Web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="SensorThings">SensorThings API</dfn>: An open, geospatial-enabled and unified  way to interconnect the <a>Internet of Things</a> (IoT) devices, data, and applications over the Web. [[SENSORTHINGS]].</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="SOS|Sensor Observation Service">Sensor Observation Service (SOS)</dfn>: A standardized HTTP interface allowing requests for observations across the Web using platform-independent calls. Sensor Observation Service [[SOS]].</p>
      <p><dfn>SPARQL</dfn>: A query language for <a>RDF</a>; it can be used to express queries across diverse data sources [[SPARQL11-OVERVIEW]].</p>
      <p><dfn>Spatial data</dfn>: Data describing anything with spatial <a>extent</a>; i.e. size, shape or position. In addition to describing things that are positioned relative to the Earth (also see <a>geospatial data</a>), spatial data may also describe things using other coordinate systems that are not related to position on the Earth, such as the size, shape and positions of cellular and sub-cellular <a>Spatial Things</a> described using the 2D or 3D Cartesian coordinate system of a specific tissue sample.</p>
      <p><dfn>Spatial database</dfn>: A spatial database, or geodatabase, is a database that is optimized to store and query data that represents objects defined in a geometric space. Most spatial databases allow representation of simple geometric objects such as points, lines and polygons and provide <a>spatial query functions</a> to determine <a>spatial relationships</a> (overlaps, touches, etc.).</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="SDI|SDIs|Spatial Data Infrastructure|Spatial Data Infrastructures">Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI)</dfn>: An ecosystem of geographic data, metadata, tools, applications, policies and users that are necessary to acquire, process, distribute, use, maintain, and preserve <a>spatial data</a>. Due to its nature (size, cost, number of interactors) an SDI is often government-related.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="spatial operator|spatial query function|spatial operators|spatial query functions">Spatial operator, spatial query function</dfn>: Function or procedure that has at least one spatial parameter in its domain or range [[ISO-19107]].</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="spatial relation|spatial relations|spatial relationship|spatial relationships">Spatial relation, spatial relationship</dfn>: Specifies how a <a>Spatial Thing</a> is located in space in relation to another Spatial Thing. Typically determined using a <a>spatial operator</a>.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Spatial Thing|Spatial Things|SpatialThing|SpatialThings">Spatial thing</dfn>: Anything with spatial <a>extent</a>, (i.e. size, shape, or position) and is a combination of the real-world phenomenon and its abstraction (the <a>feature</a>). Examples are: people, places, or bowling balls. </p>
      <p>This is different from the [[ISO-19107]] definition of a <em>Spatial Object</em> which is a <a>geometry</a> or a topology object.</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="Temporal Thing|TemporalThing|TemporalThings">Temporal thing</dfn>: Anything with temporal extent, i.e. duration. e.g. the taking of a photograph, a scheduled meeting, a GPS time-stamped track-point. [[W3C-BASIC-GEO]]</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="triple-store|triple store|triple stores|quad-store|quadstore">Triple-store (or quadstore)</dfn>: A triple-store or <a>RDF</a> store is a purpose-built database for the storage and retrieval of RDF subject-predicate-object “triples” through semantic queries. Many implementations are actually “quad-stores” as they also hold the name of the graph within which a triple is stored.</p>
      <p><dfn>Universe of discourse</dfn>: view of the real or hypothetical world that includes everything of interest [[ISO-19101]].</p>
      <p><dfn data-lt="WCS|Web Coverage Service">Web Coverage Service (WCS)</dfn>: A service offering multi-dimensional coverage data for access over the Internet. [[WCS]]</p>

      <h2>Changes since previous versions</h2>
      <p>A full change-log is available on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sdw/commits/gh-pages/bp">GitHub</a></p>
      <section id="changes-since-20160119">
        <h2>Changes since the first public working draft of 19 January 2016</h2>
        <p>The document has undergone substantial changes since the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-sdw-bp-20160119/">first public working draft</a>. Below are some of the changes made:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Focusing the document to suit the needs of practitioners: those either publishing spatial data themselves, or developing software tools to support the publication of spatial data (see sections <a href="#audience"></a> and <a href="#scope"></a>)</li>
          <li>Addition of new introductory material to explain the fundamentals of spatial data to readers (see sections <a href="#spatial-things-features-and-geometry"></a>, <a href="#coverages"></a>, <a href="#spatial-relations"></a>, <a href="#linked-data"></a> and <a href="#why-are-traditional-sdi-not-enough"></a>)</li>
          <li>Consolidation of the best practices from 30 down to 17 - based on merging duplicate or closely related best practices and focusing our scope only on spatial data concerns so that, for example, best practices relating to handling sensor data are removed (we expect these subjects to be included in future iterations of the Sensor Network deliverables of the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">working group</a>)</li>
          <li>Alignment of the remaining best practices with those from [[DWBP]] - including organizing them according to the same sub-section headings</li>
          <li>As a consequence of the consolidation and [[DWBP]] alignment, the best practices are renumbered (although the fragment-identifiers remain unchanged from those used in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-sdw-bp-20160119/">first public working draft</a>) and the cross-reference to the Requirements from [[SDW-UCR]] (section <a href="#requirements"></a>) has been updated</li>
          <li>Addition of a new, partially complete section (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-sdw-bp-20170330/#how-to-use"></a>) that is intended to help readers understand the steps they should take and the questions they should consider when publishing spatial data on the Web; referencing both the general [[DWBP]] best practices and those specific to spatial data described in this document</li>
          <li>Improvements to the <a href="#glossary"></a></li>

        <h2>Changes since working draft of 30 March 2017</h2>
        <p>The most obvious change to readers is that the best practices have been reordered with the intent to improve the readability of the document, and the empty stubs of best practices removed in the previous release are now gone. The fragment-identifiers for the best practices remain unchanged, but the numbers are different. The mapping (from old number to new) is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>BP1 &rarr; <a href="#spatial-info-dataset-metadata" class="sectionRef">BP13</a></li>

          <li><a href="#multiplegeometries" class="sectionRef"></a> (as a result of refactoring - see BP mapping above)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Section <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-sdw-bp-20170330/#how-to-use">11. How to use these best practices</a> (link to previous WD version) has been removed.</p>
        <p>Significant updates to the following best practices:</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Most of the other best practices received minor additions and improvements, without significant change to their contents. </p>
        <p>Content was added to the How to test and Benefits sections of all Best Practices.</p>
        <p>The <a href="#conclusions" class="sectionRef">Conclusions</a> section was renamed "Gaps in current practice" and content added.</p>
        <p><a href="#applicability-formatVbp" class="sectionRef"></a> was updated; it now has one table listing spatial data formats and one listing spatial data vocabularies.</p>
        <p><a href="#requirements" class="sectionRef"></a> was expanded to include cross-reference from both this document and [[DWBP]].</p>
        <P>The <a href="#glossary">Glossary</a> was updated.</P>
        <p>Plus minor, mostly editorial changes.</p>
