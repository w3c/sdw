        This specification defines WebVMT, the Web Video Map Tracks format, which is an enabling technology whose main use is for marking up external metadata track resources in connection with the HTML <code>&lt;track&gt;</code> element. WebVMT files provide map presentation, annotation and interpolation synchronized to web media content, and more generally any form of data that is time-aligned with audio or video content, including those from location-aware devices such as dashcams, drones and smartphones.

        This document is a Note, it has not been widely reviewed and should be considered as experimental only. It may serve as the base for an upcoming W3C Recommendation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document is an explanatory specification, intended to communicate and develop the draft WebVMT format through discussion with user communities.

      <section id='mountain-rescue'>
        <h2>Coastguard/Mountain Rescue</h2>
        <p>
          A missing person is reported to the rescue services, who deploy a drone to search inaccessible areas of coastline or moorland for their target. The drone relays back a live video stream from its camera and geolocation data from its GPS receiver to a remote human operator who is piloting it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the search continues, the operator spots a target on the video feed and can instantly call up an electronic map, synchronized to the video, which has been automatically following the drone’s position and plotting its ground track. The display gives the operator immediate context for the video, and allows them to override the automatic map control and zoom in to pinpoint the target’s precise location from the features visible in the video and on the map/satellite view. They mark the location and then zoom out to assess the surrounding terrain and advise the recovery team of the best approach to the target. For example, the terrain may dictate very different approach routes if either the person has twisted their ankle at the top of a cliff, or has fallen and is lying at the bottom of the same cliff, though the co-ordinates are almost identical in both cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operator has been able to make important decisions quickly, which may be life critical, and deploy recovery resources effectively.
        </p>
        <ul class='note' title='Benefits'>

      </section>
      <section id='area-survey'>
        <h2>Area Survey</h2>
        <p>
          A survey drone is equipped with a camera which records an image of the ground directly below it. The pilot is a remote human operator, tasked with surveying a defined area from particular height in order to capture the required data.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the survey progresses, zones are automatically marked on the map to represent areas which have been included. Once the drone has finished its sweep, the operator can quickly confirm whether the required area has been completely covered. If any areas have been missed, the pilot can use the map to navigate and make additional passes to fill the gaps, before returning to base.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding WebVMT files to the survey archive provides a geospatial index to the videos, allowing a particular geographic location to be found more rapidly by virtue of their small file size in comparison to their linked media. Online video archives can be indexed more quickly using this web-friendly format.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operator has been easily able to verify the quality of their own work and correct any errors, saving time and additional effort in redeployment. Video footage has been indexed by geolocation rapidly and in a search-engine-friendly format.
        </p>
        <ul class='note' title='Benefits'>
          <li>Autonomous quality assurance;</li>

      <section id='outdoor-trails'>
        <h2>Outdoor Trails</h2>
        <p>
          An outdoor sportsperson, e.g. snowboarder or cyclist, is equipped with a helmet camera and/or mobile phone to record video footage and GPS data. They set off to find new challenges and practice their skills, e.g. off-piste or on mountain trails, and discover new routes and areas that they would like to explore in future, chatting to the camera as they go. Afterwards, they upload the video to share their experience with the online community, so others can quickly identify locations of particularly interesting sections of the featured trail. Using the synchronized map view in their browser, community members can easily see where they need to go in order to explore these places for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operator has been able to fully engage in their sporting activity, without making any written notes, while simultaneously recording the details needed to guide others to the same locations. Their changing location over time can also be used to calculate speed and distance information, which can be displayed alongside the footage.

      <section id='tv-sports-coverage'>
        <h2>TV Sports Coverage</h2>
        <p>
          A TV production company is covering a sports event that takes place over a large area, e.g. rallying, road cycling or sailing, using a number of mobile video devices including competitor cams, e.g. dash cams or helmet cams, and drones to provide shots of inaccessible areas, e.g. remote terrain or over water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeds from all the cameras are streamed to the production control room, where their geolocation data are combined on a map showing the locations of every competitor and camera, each labelled for easy identification. The live map enables the director to quickly choose the best shot and anticipate where and when to deploy their drone cameras to catch competitors at critical locations on the course as the competition develops in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple operators can function concurrently, both autonomously and under central direction. Mobile assets can be monitored and deployed from an operations centre to provide optimum coverage of the developing live event.
        </p>

      <section id='proxy-explorer'>
        <h2>Proxy Explorer</h2>
        <p>
          Important details of a remote area have been captured on video. It is not possible to revisit the location for safety reasons or because it has physically changed in the intervening time. Footage can be retrospectively geotagged against a concurrent map to allow the viewer to better interpret and identify features seen in the footage. Explanatory annotations can be added to the WebVMT file to help future viewers' understanding and aggregate the collective analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple operators can contribute their observations to provide a group analysis, iteratively adding new details and discarding out-of-date information. Experts can offer insight about filmed locations, which would otherwise be inaccessible to them.

        <h2>Treasure Hunt</h2>
        <p>
          A TV production company designs a new game show which involves competitors searching for targets across a wide area, with an operations centre remotely monitoring their progress and providing updates. Competitors are equipped with body-worn video or helmet cameras to relay footage of their view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Geolocation context allow central operators to better understand the participants' actions and to remotely direct them more efficiently. Competitors' positions can displayed to the TV audience on annotated 2D- or 3D-maps for clearer presentation.

      <section id='swarm-monitoring'>
        <h2>Swarm Monitoring</h2>
        <p>
          A swarm of drones is deployed to perform a task, and their operations are monitored centrally. Geolocation details of the swarm are automatically collated and broadcast to the drone pilots, showing the locations of all the drones and each is circled with a suitable safety zone to warn their operators in case two units find themselves flying in close proximity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pilots are safely able to operate either autonomously or under the direction of central control. Extra zonal information can be added to the operators' maps to show the outer perimeter of their operating area and warn of fixed aerial hazards, e.g. a radio mast, or transient hazards, e.g. a helicopter.

        <h2>Crisis Response</h2>
        <p>
          Disaster strikes, e.g. hurricane or tsunami, and emergency response teams are deployed to the affected area. However, it is difficult to verify which problems people are facing, what resources would help them and exactly where these events are occurring. Maps are unreliable as the infrastructure has been damaged, though people on the ground have the relevant knowledge if it could be reliably recorded and shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone with a basic smartphone could video events with reliable geospatial data, as GPS receivers can operate without the need for a mobile phone signal by using satellite data, to accurately document the problems they face. Even if the cell network is not operational, this information can be physically delivered to crisis coordinators to notify them of the issues that need to be addressed, including accurate location data in a common format. Response teams can quickly search archived video by location to verify latest updates with recent context. Crisis events can be reliably recorded, knowledge can be shared and aggregated, and relief resources can be accurately targeted and deployed to the correct locations.

        <h2>Fastest Lap</h2>
        <p>
          An amateur racer attempts to set a fastest lap time in a vehicle equipped with a dashcam. The film can be reviewed with details of location and vehicle telemetry to analyse its performance, and that of the driver, to identify where improvements can be made. The ideal racing line can be determined and measured against the actual line taken, and optimum braking points can be established by suggesting and testing corrections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driver's commentary can be used to identify performance issues along with vehicle audio response, e.g. engine tone and tyres, for comparison with telemetry data to rapidly iterate testing using community analysis tools. Results can be shared online in a common format to display metrics and to demonstrate veracity.

      <section id='police-evidence'>
        <h2>Police Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          A web-based police system is established to allow dashcam video evidence of driving offences to be submitted digitally by members of the public who have witnessed them. Detectives are able to identify the time and vehicles involved directly from the uploaded footage, and accurately determine the location at which the incident occurred from the digital timed metadata included.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ability to accept open format data also makes the system available to cyclists and pedestrians who can record video with location on their helmet cameras and smartphones respectively, providing wider access to the service beyond the dashcam community. Metadata, e.g. location, from different video manufacturers is often recorded in mutually-incompatible formats, but WebVMT support enables synchronized location (and other) data to be extracted from recordings using manufacturers' or community tools, without affecting source video integrity, and submitted to the police system in a common format, significantly reducing development costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Officers have been able to identify incident locations quickly and accurately, without sacrificing evidence integrity. The online service has been made available to a wider audience of drivers, cyclists and pedestrians, without incurring additional development costs.
        </p>
        <ul class='note' title='Benefits'>
          <li>Accurate location with evidence integrity preserved;</li>
          <li>Development costs reduced;</li>

      <section id='area-monitoring'>
        <h2>Area Monitoring</h2>
        <p>
          An area of interest is monitored operationally by a collection of different mobile video devices, e.g. drones, body-worn video, helicopter, etc. Video footage, possibly in different formats, is added to an archive with location (and other) metadata in a common format which forms a time-location index suitable for rapid parsing by a web crawler. Users can submit online queries to search by location and return a time-ordered sequence of video frame stills captured within a radial distance of the chosen location. Alternatively, sensor data can be searched, e.g. for high readings, to return matching geotagged video frames for further analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Video archives can be quickly indexed using a common metadata format regardless of video encoding, e.g. MPEG, WebM, OGG, and video files are only accessed in case of a positive search result, which reduces bandwidth in comparison to embedded metadata. Linked files also allow different security permissions to be applied to the crawling and querying processes, so an AI algorithm can be authorised to read metadata without being able to access image content if there are security concerns over data privacy, e.g. illicit facial recognition.
        </p>
        <ul class='note' title='Benefits'>

        <h2>Vehicle Collision</h2>
        <p>
          Dashcam footage is searched to automatically identify vehicle collisions from impact acceleration profiles recorded in video metadata. Dashcam manufacturers typically embed metadata in an unpublished format and provide a proprietary video player to allow users to display it. Exporting embedded metadata to a linked file in a web-friendly format enables searchable video archive data to be shared quickly and easily, without affecting evidence integrity, and to be accessed through a common web interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vehicles can be automatically monitored using a low-cost dashcam and web-based tools to ensure that collisions are accurately recorded by drivers and that commercial vehicles remain safe and undamaged. Interoperability means that users are not limited to a particular brand and can share evidence with insurers and the police in a common format without damaging its integrity.

        <h2>Golden Tutorial</h2>
        <p>
          Augmented reality (AR) software is used to control assets or view content in situ at a particular location. For example, nearby street lights can be switched off or on by a service engineer for maintenance purposes, or an architect can see how their structural design integrates with the surrounding landscape at its proposed location before any building work has started.
        </p>
        <p>
          Video footage can be recorded with location, camera orientation and other metadata so AR overlays be generated on demand. Such recordings can be used to demonstrate how AR content is displayed and controlled in order to educate users with a 'golden tutorial', to provide 'proof of action' as evidence of work done for auditing purposes, or to create example data for AR software testing and debugging.

        <p>
          A user triggers an audio track which provides guidance about the local area or instruction for a known object, e.g. Web of Things (WoT) device at that location. The audio timeline is synchronized with events that can display AR content, control WoT devices and display points of interest on a map which provide guidance with real world context by highlighting places or objects of interest and showing possible actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can be guided by a virtual assistant through an area of interest or sequence of actions augmented with AR/VR and WoT devices to visualise events and by an annotated map or model to provide additional geospatial context. Greater insight is given to the user by showing detailed views of the location on a map or internal structure of the identified object using a virtual model.

      <h2>State of the Art</h2>
      <p>
        No standard format currently exists by which web browsers can synchronise geolocation data with video. Though many browser-supported formats exist to present the two data streams separately, e.g. MPEG for video and GPX for geolocation, there is no viable synchronisation mechanism for video playback time with geolocation information.
      </p>
      <section id='current-solutions'>
        <h2>Current Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          Material Exchange Format (MXF) was developed by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) to synchronise metadata, including geolocation, with audio and video streams using a register of key-length-value (KLV) triples. The breadth of its scope has resulted in interoperability issues, as different vendors implement different parts of the standard, and has produced implementations from high-profile companies which are mutually incompatible. KLVs can also be embedded within MPEG files, though this does not address the synchronisation issue for other web video formats such as WebM.
        </p>
        <p>
          Video camera manufacturers have taken various approaches, resulting in a number of non-standard solutions including embedding geolocation data within the MPEG metadata stream in disparate formats, such as Motion Imagery Standards Board (MISB) or Go-Pro Metadata Format (GPMF), or recording a separate geolocation file in a proprietary format alongside the associated video file. From a hardware perspective, a few high-end cameras provide geotagging out of the box and all require an add-on device to support this feature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Geospatial data are not currently accessible in the video Document Object Model (DOM) in HTML nor via video playback APIs in smartphones, e.g. Android, though their host devices are typically equipped with both a video camera and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver capable of capturing the required information.
        </p>
        <p>
          In sharp contrast, still photos have a well-established geotagging standard called Exif, which was published by the Japan Electronic Industries Development Association (JEIDA) in 1995 and defines a metadata tag to embed geolocation data within TIFF and JPEG images. This is widely supported by manufacturers of photographic equipment and software worldwide, including low-end smartphones, making this feature cheap and accessible to the public.

        <h2>Growing Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Historically, there has been no requirement for a comparable video standard, but the urgency for such a standard is growing fast due to the emerging markets for 'mobile video devices,' e.g. drones, dashcams, body-worn video and helmet cameras, as well as the rise in high-quality video and geolocation support in the global smartphone market.

      <section id='accessible-standard'>
        <h2>Accessible Standard Opportunity</h2>
        <p>
          Using current W3C recommendations, it is possible for a programmer to synchronise video-geolocation 'metadata' with a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element using a <code>&lt;track&gt;</code> child element. However, this is a non-trivial development task which requires an understanding of the video DOM events and Javascript file handling, making it inaccessible to the vast majority of web users. Video metadata tracks are an identified kind of track data in HTML, though metadata content is difficult to access due to the text-based nature of existing DOM support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Establishing a standard file format would allow interoperability and information sharing between the public, the emergency services, police and other mobile video device users, e.g. drone pilots, giving cheaper and easier access to this important resource. Native web browser support for geotagged video using this file format would also make this freely accessible to most web users and enable integration with existing web services such as online maps and search engines. Current low-end smartphones already provide suitable hardware to concurrently capture video and geolocation streams, which would make this technology easily accessible to the general public, and encourage the user and developer communities to grow rapidly.

      <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
      <p>
        This proposal constitutes a lightweight markup language to synchronise video with geolocation data for display on electronic maps, such as OpenStreetMaps. It offers presentational control of the map display, e.g. pan and zoom, and annotation to highlight map features to the viewer, e.g. paths and zones.
      </p>
      <p>
        WebVMT (Web Video Map Tracks) format is intended for marking up external map track resources, and its main use is for files synchronising video content with an annotated map presentation. Ideas have been borrowed from existing W3C formats, including WebVTT's HTML binding and its block and cue structures, and SVG's approach to drawing and interpolation, in order to display output on an electronic map.
      </p>
      <p>
        The format mimics WebVTT's structure and syntax for media synchronisation, with cue details listed in an accessible text-based file linked to a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> DOM element by a child <code>&lt;track&gt;</code> element in an HTML document.

        The meaning of <code>for</code> and <code>tileurl</code> attributes for user agents is an open question. Initial solutions can be built using Javascript, with existing map libraries such as Leaflet, though the vision is that future user agents will handle map rendering in the longer term.

        <h2>Conformance classes</h2>
        <p>
          This specification describes the conformance criteria for user agents (relevant to implementors) and <a>WebVMT files</a> (relevant to authors and authoring tool implementors).
        </p>
        <p class='note'>
          <a href='#syntax'>Syntax</a> defines what consists of a valid <a>WebVMT file</a>. Authors need to follow the requirements therein, and are encouraged to use a conformance checker. <a href='#parsing'>Parsing</a> defines how user agents are to interpret a file labelled as <a href='#text-vmt'>text/vmt</a>, for both valid and invalid <a>WebVMT files</a>. The parsing rules are more tolerant to author errors than the syntax allows, in order to provide for extensibility and to still render cues that have some syntax errors.
        </p>
        <aside class='example' title='Conformance Error'>
          For example, the parser will create two cues even if the blank line between them is skipped. This is clearly a mistake, so a conformance checker will flag it as an error, but it is still useful to render the cues to the user.
        </aside>
        <p>
          User agents fall into several (possibly overlapping) categories with different conformance requirements.

          <dd>
            All processing requirements in this specification apply. The user agent must also be conforming implementations of the IDL fragments in this specification, as described in the <a data-cite='WEBIDL-1' data-no-xref=''>Web IDL</a> specification.

            All processing requirements in this specification apply, except parts of <a href='#parsing'>Parsing</a> that relate to stylesheets and CSS, and all of <a href='#css-extensions'>CSS Extensions</a>. The user agent must instead only render the <a>WebVMT cue</a> in an appropriate manner. Any other styling instructions are optional.

          </dt>
          <dd>
            All processing requirements in this specification apply. However, the user agent will need to apply the CSS related features in <a href='#parsing'>Parsing</a>, and <a href='#css-extensions'>CSS Extensions</a> in such a way that the rendered results are equivalent to what a full CSS supporting renderer produces.

          </dt>
          <dd>
            All processing requirements in this specification apply. However, only a limited set of CSS styles is allowed because <a>user agents that do not support a full HTML CSS engine</a> will need to implement CSS functionality equivalents. User agents that support a full CSS engine must therefore limit the CSS styles they apply for WebVMT so as to enable identical rendering without bleeding in extra CSS styles that are beyond the WebVMT specification.

          </dd>
          <dd>
            When an authoring tool is used to edit a non-conforming <a>WebVMT file</a>, it may preserve the conformance errors in sections of the file that were not edited during the editing session (i.e. an editing tool is allowed to round-trip erroneous content). However, an authoring tool must not claim that the output is conformant if errors have been so preserved.

          For example, a cue with an identifier consisting of the characters U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A followed by U+030A COMBINING RING ABOVE (a decomposed character sequence), or the character U+212B ANGSTROM SIGN (a compatibility character), will not match a selector targeting a cue with an ID consisting of the character U+00C5 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE (a precomposed character).

      <h2>Data Model</h2>
      <p class='ednote'>
        The data model of WebVMT consists of four key elements: the linked media file, the video viewport, cues, and the map viewport. The linked media file contains audio or video data with which cues are synchronized. The video viewport is the rendering area for video output. Cues are containers consisting of a set of metadata lines. The map viewport is the rendering area for metadata output, for example graphical annotations overlaid on an online map.
      </p>
      <section class='informative' id='overview'>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The <a>WebVMT file</a> is a container file for chunks of data that are time-aligned with a video or audio resource. It can therefore be regarded as a serialisation format for time-aligned data.
        </p>
        <p>
          A WebVMT file starts with a header and then contains a series of data blocks. If a data block has a start time, it is called a WebVMT cue. A comment is another kind of data block.
        </p>
        <p>
          A WebVMT file carries cues which are identified as <a data-cite='HTML51/semantics-embedded-content.html#attr-track-kind-keyword-metadata'>metadata</a> and specified in the <a data-cite='HTML51/semantics-embedded-content.html#attr-track-kind'>kind</a> attribute of the <a data-cite='HTML51/semantics-embedded-content.html#the-track-element'>track</a> element in the <a data-cite='HTML51' data-no-xref=''>HTML</a> specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data kind of a WebVMT file is externally specified, such as in a HTML file’s <a data-cite='HTML51/semantics-embedded-content.html#the-track-element'>track</a> element. The environment is responsible for interpreting the data correctly.
        </p>
        <p>

        WebVMT file parsing is similar to <a data-cite='WEBVTT/#parsing'>WebVTT parsing</a>, though many of those steps can be skipped as WebVMT files are metadata files.

      <section id='webvmt-file-parsing'>
        <h2>WebVMT File Parsing</h2>
        <p>
          A <dfn>WebVMT parser</dfn>, given an input byte stream, a <a data-cite='HTML51/semantics-embedded-content.html#text-track-list-of-cues'>text track list of cues</a> |output|, and a collection of <a data-cite='CSSOM-1/#css-style-sheets'>CSS style sheets</a> |stylesheets|, must decode the byte stream using the UTF-8 decode algorithm, and then must parse the resulting string according to the <a>WebVMT parser algorithm</a>. This results in <a>WebVMT cues</a> being added to |output|, and <a data-cite='CSSOM-1/#css-style-sheets'>CSS style sheets</a> being added to |stylesheets|.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>WebVMT parser</a>, specifically its conversion and parsing steps, is typically run asynchronously, with the input byte stream being updated incrementally as the resource is downloaded; this is called an <dfn>incremental WebVMT parser</dfn>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>WebVMT parser</a> verifies a file signature before parsing the provided byte stream. If the stream lacks this WebVMT file signature, then the parser aborts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>WebVMT parser algorithm</dfn> is as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Let |input| be the string being parsed, after conversion to Unicode, and with the following transformations applied:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Replace all U+0000 NULL characters by U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTERs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Replace each U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF) character pair by a single U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Replace all remaining U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN characters by U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Let |position| be a pointer into |input|, initially pointing at the start of the string. In an <a>incremental WebVMT parser</a>, when this algorithm (or further algorithms that it uses) moves the |position| pointer, the user agent must wait until appropriate further characters from the byte stream have been added to |input| before moving the pointer, so that the algorithm never reads past the end of the |input| string. Once the byte stream has ended, and all characters have been added to |input|, then the |position| pointer may, when so instructed by the algorithms, be moved past the end of |input|.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let |seen cue| be false.
            </li>
            <li>
              If |input| is less than six characters long, then abort these steps. The file does not start with the correct <a>WebVMT file</a> signature and was therefore not successfully processed.
            </li>
            <li>
              If |input| is exactly six characters long but does not exactly equal "<code>WEBVMT</code>", then abort these steps. The file does not start with the correct <a>WebVMT file</a> signature and was therefore not successfully processed.

            <li>
              If |input| is more than six characters long but the first six characters do not exactly equal "<code>WEBVMT</code>", or the seventh character is not a U+0020 SPACE character, a U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) character, or a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character, then abort these steps.

        <h2>WebVMT Cue Text Parsing</h2>
        <p>
          A <dfn>WebVMT node object</dfn> is a conceptual construct used to represent components of cue text so that its processing can be described without reference to the underlying syntax.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two broad classes of <a>WebVMT node objects</a>: <a>WebVMT internal node objects</a> and <a>WebVMT leaf node objects</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <dfn>WebVMT internal node objects</dfn> are those that can contain further <a>WebVMT node objects</a>. They are conceptually similar to elements in HTML or the DOM. <a>WebVMT internal node objects</a> have an ordered list of child <a>WebVMT node objects</a>. The <a>WebVMT internal node object</a> is said to be the parent of the children. Cycles do not occur; the parent-child relationships so constructed form a tree structure.

            The <span class='css'><dfn class='export'>::cue(<var>selector</var>)</dfn></span> pseudo-element with an argument must have an argument that consists of a <a data-cite='SELECTORS4/#selector'>CSS selector</a>.

          <p>
            Pseudo-elements apply to elements that are matched by selectors. For the purpose of this section, that element is the <i>matched element</i>. The pseudo-element defined below affects the styling of text track regions that are being rendered for the <i>matched element</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span class='css'><dfn class='export'>::cue-map</dfn></span> pseudo-element (with no argument) matches the <a>WebVMT map object</a> constructed for the <i>matched element</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same properties that apply to <span class='css'>::cue</span> apply to the <span class='css'>::cue-map</span> pseudo-element; other properties set on the pseudo-element must be ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a user agent is rendering a text track map according to the <a>rules for updating the display of WebVMT text tracks</a>, the <a>WebVMT map object</a> used in the rendering can be matched by the above pseudo-element. User agents that support the pseudo-element must dynamically update renderings accordingly.

          <h2>CSS Cascades</h2>
          <p>
            For the purpose of determining the <a data-cite='CSS-CASCADE-4/#cascade'>cascade</a> of the declarations in <code>STYLE</code> blocks of a WebVMT file, the relative order of appearance of the style sheets must be the same order as they were added to the collection, and the order of appearance of the collection must be after any style sheets that apply to the associated <a data-cite='HTML51/semantics-embedded-content.html#the-video-element'><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></a> or <a data-cite='HTML51/semantics-embedded-content.html#the-audio-element'><code>&lt;audio&gt;</code></a> element’s document.
          </p>
          <aside class='example' title='Cascade Precedence'>
            <p>
              For example, given the following (invalid) HTML document:
            </p>
            <pre class='nohighlight'>
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Invalid cascade example&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;video controls autoplay src="video.webm"&gt;
  &lt;track default src="cascade.vmt"&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
  ::cue { fill: red; }
&lt;/style&gt;
            </pre>
            <p>
              And the "cascade.vmt" file contains:
            </p>
            <pre class='nohighlight'>
WEBVMT

STYLE
::cue { fill: lime; }

NOTE Red or green?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.000

            </pre>
            <p>
              The <span class='css'>fill:lime</span> declaration would win, because it is last in the <a data-cite='CSS-CASCADE-4/#cascade'>cascade</a>, even though the <a data-cite='HTML51/semantics-embedded-content.html#the-style-element'><code>&lt;style&gt;</code></a> element is after the <a data-cite='HTML51/semantics-embedded-content.html#the-video-element'><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></a> element in the document order.

            <a>WebVMT zones</a> represent regions in the mapped space, which could be extended to support <a>WebVMT path</a> properties for their centroid's motion and include dynamic properties such as area and volume.
          </p>
          <p>
            Care should be taken to build a lightweight interface which includes simple, common properties that are useful to most use cases and avoids overloading with unnecessary edge cases, processing overheads and complexity.

        <h2>Text-Based Format Security</h2>
        <p>
          As with any text-based format, it is possible to construct malicious content that might cause buffer over-runs, value overflows (e.g. string representations of integers that overflow a given word length), and the like. Implementers should take care in implementing a parser that over-long lines, field values, or encoded values do not cause security problems.

        <h2>Styling-Related Privacy and Security</h2>
        <p>
          WebVMT can embed CSS style sheets, which will be applied in user agents that support CSS. Under these circumstances, the privacy and security considerations of CSS apply, with the following caveats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such style sheets cannot fetch any external resources, and it is important for privacy that user agents do not allow this. Otherwise, WebVMT files could be authored such that a third party is notified when the user watches a particular video, and even the current time in that video.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible for a user agent to offer user style sheets, but their presence and nature will not be detectable by scripts running in the same user agent (e.g. browser) since the CSS object model for such style sheets is not exposed to script and there is no way to get the computed style for pseudo-elements other than <span class='css'>::before</span> and <span class='css'>::after</span> with the <a data-cite='CSSOM-1#dom-window-getcomputedstyle'>getComputedStyle()</a> API.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class='information' id='scripting-related-security'>
        <h2>Scripting-Related Security</h2>
        <p>
          WebVMT does not include or enable scripting. It is important that user agents do not support a way to execute script embedded in a WebVMT file.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it is possible to construct and deliver a file that is designed not to present timed metadata, but instead to provide timed input (‘triggers’) to a script system. A poorly-written script or script system might then cause security, privacy or other problems; however, this consideration really applies to the script system. Since WebVMT supplies these triggers at their timestamps, a malicious file might present such triggers very rapidly, perhaps causing undue resource consumption.
        </p>

      <section class='information' id='location-related-security'>
        <h2>Location-Related Security</h2>
        <p>
          WebVMT provides a common format in which to share location data synchronized with video for the web. Proper consideration should be given to any sensitive details that may be revealed as a result of sharing such personal information. For example, posting a geotagged image online can reveal the location of the content creator at a particular time which can infer their absence from distant locations since travelling takes time. The identities of people who appear in video frames may be determined visually to also reveal their presence at a nearby location or their absence from a distant one.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to share content responsibly, users should consider:
          <ol>
            <li>What is included?</li>
            <li>How can it be used?</li>
            <li>What can it tell others?</li>
          </ol>
          Further guidance for users, developers and regulators can be found in the W3C Note: <a data-cite='RESPONSIBLE-USE-SPATIAL' data-no-xref=''>The Responsible Use of Spatial Data</a>.
