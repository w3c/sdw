      <h2>Motivation and background</h2>
      <p>Temporal information is so common that it’s hard to find a real world Web service without it. For example,
        whenever you place an online order, the order date is always part of your order. When you reserve a car at a car
        rental site, you have to specify the dates you need it. In response to this need, a temporal ontology, OWL-Time,
        has been developed for describing the temporal content of Web pages, or the temporal properties of any resource
        denoted using a web identifier (URI), including real-world things if desired.</p>
      <p>This document presents the OWL encodings of the ontology. For a first-order logic axiomatization of the
        ontology, see [<a href="#HP-04"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HP-04</span></a>].</p>

      <h2>Changes from previous versions</h2>
      <p>This version of OWL-Time was developed in the Spatial Data on the Web Working Group (a joint activity involving
        W3C and the Open Geospatial Consortium). It is based on the earlier draft by Hobbs and Pan, [<a href="#OWL-T">OWL-T</a>]
        with modifications proposed by Cox, [<a href="#CO-15">CO-15</a>] to support more general temporal positions.

        <li><code>GeneralDateTimeDescription</code> and <code>GeneralDurationDescription</code> generalize the
          corresponding classes from the draft, for cases which the temporal reference system is not fixed to the

        <li><code>TimePosition</code> and <code>Duration</code> enable position or duration to be described using a
          number or nominal value <br>
        </li>
        <li>the property <code>hasTRS</code> enables time values to be associated with a temporal reference system,

<!-- superseded by ISSUE-65
      <p class="issue" data-number="64">(Was local Issue 1) Most of the properties defined in the original ontology have global constraints on the domain and range. If the
        <code>rdfs:domain</code> were left unspecified, the properties could be used more widely without undesirable

        The Time ontology is concerned only with formalizing temporal intervals and instants, and does not include any
        predicates to tie temporal objects to spatial entities or features, or other things. The editors note that
        predicates that concern temporal behaviour and properties will usually be part of an application or associated
        with a community of practice. Nevertheless, there may be some generic predicates that could be conveniently
        provided as part of the generic time ontology. Some may already exist in the ontology (<code>before</code>, <code>after</code>,
        <code>hasEnd</code>, <code>hasBeginning</code>, <code>intervalEquals</code> ) but their <code>rdfs:domain</code> is <code>:TemporalEntity</code> or <code>:ProperInterval</code>,
        so this may need to be generalized to avoid inappropriate entailments. Else predicates with similar names
        could be provided for linking to other entities. </p>

        concerns, by extending the <code>xsd:dateTime</code> syntax . The editors consider that would be the wrong
        direction since it would make the encoding inconsistent with all XSD-based processors. On the other hand,
        specific RDF properties matching the ones proposed in EDTF could be used to make it amenable to RDF reasoning.
        However, it could be done in a separate namespace. Note that some of the concerns in EDTF are
        already accommodated in OWL-Time (e.g. 'unspecified' appears to only require the timeUnit to be chosen

      <h2>Principles and vocabulary overview</h2>
      <section id="topology">
        <h3>Topological Temporal Relations</h3>
        <p>The basic structure of the ontology is based on an algebra of binary relations on intervals (e.g., meets,
          overlaps) developed by Allen and Ferguson [<a href="#AL-84">AL-84</a>, <a href="#AF-97">AF-97</a>] for
          representing qualitative temporal information, and to address the problem of reasoning about such information.
        </p>
        <p>This is implemented in the ontology starting with a class <code>TemporalEntity</code> which has properties
          that link to the temporal instants that define its beginning and end. There are two subclasses: <code>Interval</code>
          and <code>Instant</code>, and they are the only two subclasses of <code>TemporalEntity</code>. Intervals
          are, intuitively, things with extent and instants are, intuitively, point-like in that they have no interior
          points, but it is generally safe to think of an instant as an interval with zero length, where the beginning
          and end are the same. The class <code>Interval</code> has one subclass <code>ProperInterval</code>, which
          corresponds with the common understanding of intervals, in that the beginning and end are distinct, and whose
          membership is therefore disjoint from <code>Instant</code>. The class <code>ProperInterval</code> has one
          subclass, <code>DateTimeInterval</code>, whose position and extent may be expressed using a single <code>GeneralDateTimeDescription
           </code> or <code>xsd:dateTime</code>. </p>

          -->
        
        <p>Allen and Ferguson [<a href="#AL-84">AL-84</a>, <a href="#AF-97">AF-97</a>] have developed a calculus of
          binary relations on intervals (e.g., meets, overlaps) for representing qualitative temporal information and
          address the problem of reasoning about such information. The relations between intervals defined in their
          calculus can be defined in a relatively straightforward fashion in terms of <code>before</code> and identity
          on the beginning and end points. The standard interval calculus assumes all intervals are proper, whose
          beginning and end are different. </p>

      <section id="trs-clock-calendar">
        <h3>Temporal reference systems, clocks, calendars</h3>
        The position of an Instant may be given using the datatype <code>xsd:dateTime</code>which is built in to OWL 2[<a href="#OWL-2">OWL-2</a>], and uses the conventional
        Gregorian calendar and 24-hour clock. While this satisfies most web applications, many other calendars and
        temporal reference systems are used in particular cultural and scholarly contexts. For example, the Julian
        calendar was used throughout Europe until the 16<sup>th</sup> century, and is still used for computing key dates
        in some orthodox Christian communities. Lunisolar (e.g. Hebrew) and lunar (e.g. Islamic) calendars are currently
        in use in some communities, and many similar have been used historically. In scientific and technical
        applications, Julian date counts the number of days since the beginning of 4713 BCE, and Loran-C, Unix and GPS
        time are based on seconds counted from a specified origin in 1958, 1970 and 1980, respectively. Archaeological
        and geological applications use chronometric scales based on years counted backwards from ‘the present’ (defined
        as 1950 for radiocarbon dating [<a href="#RC-14">RC-14</a>]), or using named periods associated with specified
        correlation markers [<a href="#CR-05">CR-05</a>, <a href="#CR-14">CR-14</a>, <a href="#MF-13">MF-13</a>].
        Dynastic calendars (counting years within eras defined by the reign of a monarch or dynasty) were used earlier
        in many cultures. In order to support these more general applications, the representation of temporal position
        and duration must be flexible, and annotated with the <em>temporal reference system </em>in use. <br>
        <p>A set of ordered intervals (e.g. named dynasties, geological periods, geomagnetic reversals, tree rings) can
          make a simple form of temporal reference system that supports logical reasoning, known as an <em>ordinal
            temporal reference system </em>[<a href="#ISO-19108">ISO-19108</a>]. </p>
        <p>Measurement of duration needs a <em>clock</em>. In its most general form a clock is just a regularly
          repeating physical event ('tick') and a counting mechanism for the 'ticks'. These counts may be used to
          logically relate two events and to calculate a duration between the events.</p>
        <p>A <em>calendar </em>is a set of algorithms that enables clock counts to be converted into practical
          everyday dates and times related to the movement of astronomical bodies (day, month, year). </p>
        <p>For many purposes it is convenient to make temporal calculations in terms of clock durations that exceed
          everyday units such as days, weeks, months and years, using a representation of temporal position in a <em>temporal
            coordinate system</em> [<a href="#ISO-19108">ISO-19108</a>], i.e. on a number line with a specified origin,
          such as Julian date, or Unix time. This may be converted to calendar units when necessary for human
          consumption. </p>
        <p>Nevertheless, in practice much temporal information is not well-defined, in that there may be no clear
          statement about the assumed underlying calendar and clock. </p>
      </section>
      <section id="time-position-units">
        <h3>Time position and time units</h3>
        <p>OWL 2 has two built-in datatypes relating to time: <code>xsd:dateTime</code> and <code>xsd:dateTimeStamp </code>[<a

          href="#OWL-2">OWL-2</a>]. Other XSD types such as <code>xsd:date</code>, <code>xsd:gYear</code>, <code>xsd:gMonth
         </code> and <code>xsd:gMonth</code> [<a href="#XSD-D">XSD-D</a>] are also commonly used in OWL applications.
        These provide for a compact representation of time positions using the conventional Gregorian calendar and
        24-hour clock, with timezone offset from UTC if required.</p>
        <p>Three classes in the ontology support a more explicit description of temporal position. All have a
        property <code>hasTRS</code> to indicate the temporal reference system <code>TRS</code>. <code>TimePosition</code> has properties to alternatively describe the position using a number (i.e. a temporal coordinate), or a
        nominal value (e.g. geologic time period, dynastic name, archeological era). <code>GeneralDateTimeDescription</code> has
        a set of properties to specify a date-time using calendar and clock elements. Its subclass <code>DateTimeDescription
         </code> fixes the temporal reference system to the Gregorian calendar, so the <code>hasTRS</code> property
        may be omitted on individuals from this class.</p>
        <p class="note"><code>DateTimeDescription</code> covers the case that was defined in the original note, and
          retains the original class name. </p>
        <figure> <img title="DataTimePosition" alt="UML-style diagram of classes for temporal position" src="./images/DateTimeDescription.png">
          <figcaption>Classes for temporal position.</figcaption> </figure>
        <p> Following the theoretical basis laid out by Allen and Ferguson, a time position has a finite extent,
          corresponding to the precision or <em>temporal unit </em>used. Thus,a <code>GeneralDateTimeDescription</code>
          or <code>DateTimeDescription</code> is strictly always a description of an interval (<code>DateTimeInterval</code>),
          not an instant, with a duration corresponding to the value of its<code>unitType</code>.
        </p>
        <p>We use two different sets of properties for <code>GeneralDateTimeDescription</code> or <code>DateTimeDescription</code>
          and <code>GeneralDurationDescription</code> or <code>DurationDescription</code>, because their ranges are
          different. For example, <code>year</code> (in <code>DateTimeDescription</code>) has a range of <code>xsd:gYear</code>,
          while <code>years</code> (in <code>GeneralDurationDescription</code>) has a range of <code>xsd:decimal</code>
          so that you can say duration of 2.5 years.</p>
        <p class="note">These classes address the 'date' and 'time' requirement from <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#DateTimeDuration">5.7

      </section>
      <section id="duration">
        <h3>Duration </h3>
        <p>The duration of an interval (or temporal sequence) can have many different descriptions. An interval can be 1
          day 2 hours, or 26 hours, or 1560 minutes, and so on. It is useful to be able to talk about these descriptions
          in a convenient way as independent objects, and to talk about their equivalences. An interval can have
          multiple duration descriptions (e.g., 2 days, 48 hours), but can only have one duration. </p>
        <p>Three classes support the description of the duration of an entity. <code>Duration</code> has
          properties to describe the duration using a scaled number (i.e. a temporal quantity). <code>GeneralDurationDescription
           </code> has a set of properties to specify a duration using calendar and clock elements, the definitions of
          which are given in the associated TRS description. Its subclass <code>DurationDescription</code> fixes the
          temporal reference system to the Gregorian calendar, so the <code>hasTRS</code> property may be omitted on
          individuals from this class.</p>

          may be represented directly, using this ontology, as a set of <code>ProperInterval</code>s, along with enough
          inter-relationships to support the necessary ordering relationships. See example below of <a href="#geologictimescale">Geologic
            Timescale</a>. </p>

        However, the ontology was incomplete in scope, and the example datasets were selective. Furthermore, the use of a class from an external ontology as the range of an <code>ObjectProperty</code> in OWL-Time creates an undesirable dependency. Therefore, reference to the time zone class has been replaced with the 'stub' class in the normative part of this version of OWL-Time.</p>

        <p>Other duration concepts can be straightforwardly defined. For example, duration "Year" could be defined as a

</pre>
        <p>We use "cardinality = 0" instead of restricting the values of days, etc. to 0. The reason is that using
          "cardinality = 0" means all those properties/fields (days, etc.) should not be specified (i.e., the
          granularity is "year"), while restricting all those values to 0 means they all have a fixed value of 0 (i.e.,
          x years 0 months 0 days ...) and the granularity is actually "second", which is not the correct semantics of
          "year".</p>
        <p>Note that there is a distinction between a year as a duration and a calendar year. The year from December 22,
          2006 to December 21, 2007 is the former but not the latter.</p>

        <h3>DateTimeDescription vs dateTime</h3>
<!--        <p class="note">This example carried over from [<a href="#OWL-T">OWL-T</a>]. </p> -->
        <p>The following example illustrates the difference between using <code>DateTimeDescription</code> and using
          the XML datatype <code>dateTime</code>. An instant that represents the start of a meeting, called <code>meetingStart</code>,
          happens at 10:30am EST on 01/01/2006 can be expressed using both <code>inXSDDateTime</code> and <code>inDateTime</code>
          in OWL as:</p>
        <pre>ex:meetingStart
      a       :Instant ;
      :inDateTime
              ex:meetingStartDescription ;
      :inXSDDateTime
              2006-01-01T10:30:00-5:00 .

ex:meetingStartDescription
      a       :DateTimeDescription ;
      :unitType :unitMinute ;
      :minute 30 ;
      :hour 10 ;
      :day 1 ;
      :dayOfWeek :Sunday ;
      :dayOfYear 1 ;
      :week 1 ;
      :month 1 ;
      :timeZone &lt;<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/est">https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/est</a>&gt; ;
      :year 2006 .</pre>
        <p>It is much more concise to use the XML Schema datatype <code>dateTime</code>. 
        However, using <code>DateTimeDescription</code> more information can be expressed, 
        such as "week", "day of week" and "day of year", so in the example, we can also know that 01/01/2006 is Sunday, 
        on the first day of the year, and in the first week of the year. 
        Since, each field of <code>DateTimeDescription</code> is separate it is easier to extract the value of some fields 
        for the later use and easier to reason about.</p>
        <p>The <code>timeZone</code> property points to a definition of US Eastern Standard Time. </p>

        <h3>Use of different temporal reference systems</h3>
        <p>The use of different temporal reference systems for the same absolute time is illustrated in the following
          examples. Abby's birthday is an <code>Instant</code> whose position may be expressed using the conventional
          XSD <code>dateTime</code> type as <code>2001-05-23T08:20:00+08:00</code>:</p>

        <h3>Temporal precision using DateTimeDescription vs dateTime vs TimePosition</h3>
        <p>For the purposes of radiocarbon dating (which is the technique used in geological age determination for
          materials up to around 60,000 years old) 'the Present' is conventionally fixed at 1950 [<a href="#RC-14">RC-14</a>].
          This can be described as an individual <code>:Instant</code>, with its position expressed using any of the
          three alternatives: </p>
        <pre>geol:Present
  a :Instant ;
  :inDateTime [

      :unitType :unitYear ;
      :year "1950"^^xsd:gYear ;

  rdfs:label "The present"^^xsd:string ;
. </pre>
        <p>Expressed using :<code>DateTimeDescription</code> the :<code>unitType</code> - which determines the
          precision - is set to:<code>unitYear</code>, and only the :<code>year</code> element is provided in the value.
          The TRS value is not provided explicitly, as it is fixed in the ontology description to <a href="http://www.opengis.net/def/uom/ISO-8601/0/Gregorian">http://www.opengis.net/def/uom/ISO-8601/0/Gregorian</a>.</p>
        <p>In the :<code>TimePosition</code> variant, the TRS is given as 
        <a href="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/ChronometricGeologicTime">http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/ChronometricGeologicTime</a>
          which has units of millions of years, starting from the present, positive backwards.</p> 
        <p>For the value expressed using <code>xsd:dateTime</code> the
          position within the year is set arbitrarily to midnight at the beginning of 1st January. 
          This level of precision is strictly spurious, but is required to satisfy the lexical pattern of the datatype.</p>

        <p>iCalendar [<a href="#DE-09">DE-09</a>] is a widely supported standard for personal data interchange. It provides
        the definition of a common format for openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling information across the

        iCalendar. For example, duration of 15 days, 5 hours and 20 seconds is represented in iCalendar as P15DT5H0M20S,

        <h3>Geologic timescale described as a graph of ProperInterval individuals</h3>
        <p>The geologic timescale is defined as a set of named intervals arranged in a hierarchy, such that there is
          only one subdivision of the intervals of each rank (e.g. 'Era') by a set of intervals of the next rank (in
          this case 'Period') [<a href="#CR-05">CR-05</a>]. Since the relative ordering is well-defined this graph can
          therefore serve as an ordinal temporal reference system. Fig. 5 shows how the geologic timescale can be
          expressed as a set of <code>:ProperIntervals</code> related to each other using only <code>intervalMetBy</code>, <code>intervalStartedBy</code>,
          <code>intervalFinishedBy</code>. Many other interval relationships follow logically from the ones shown (for
          example 'Neogene Period' :<code>intervalDuring </code>'Cenozoic Era') but the ones shown are sufficient to describe
          the full topology. </p>

          <figcaption>Part of the geologic timescale formalized as ProperIntervals, with ordering relationships
            described using the predicates defined in this ontology.</figcaption> </figure>
        <p> For example, the interval known as the 'Phanerozoic Eon' is described as follows:</p>
        <pre>geol:Phanerozoic
  rdf:type :ProperInterval ;
  :hasBeginning geol:BasePhanerozoic ;

</pre>
        <p>The beginning of the Phanerozoic is an <code>Instant</code>, described as follows:</p>

        <h3>A Use Case for Scheduling</h3>

          Will there be an overlap? </p>
        <p>In this use case we can specify the facts about the telecon and the meeting using our ontology in OWL that

        <h3>Web commerce applications</h3>
<!--        <p class="note">This example carried over from [<a href="#OWL-T">OWL-T</a>]. </p> -->
        <p>Congo.com and Bravo Air are examples from the OWL-S 0.9 draft release [<a href="#OWL-S">OWL-S</a>]. Congo.com
          is a fictitious book-selling service site, and Bravo Air is a fictitious airline-ticketing service site. These
          examples demonstrate how the time ontology can be used to support OWL-S, including use cases for defining
          input parameters and (conditional) output parameters. </p>
        <h4>Input Parameters</h4>
        <p>In the profile of the Congo.com example (i.e. CongoProfile.owl), for example, our time ontology is currently
          used for describing the input parameter <code>CreditCardExpirationDate</code>:</p>
        <pre>profile:CreditCardExpirationDate
      a       profile:ParameterDescription ;
      profile:parameterName
              creditCardExpirationDate ;
      profile:restrictedTo
              :<b>Instant</b> ;
      profile:referTo
              congoProcess:creditCardExpirationDate .</pre>
        <p>The namespace “time” points to the location of the OWL code for the time ontology. In this example <code>Instant</code>
          is used to describe <code>CreditCardExpirationDate</code>, because the expiration date is actually an instant
          -- the midnight, of the day the credit card expires. </p>
        <p>In the Bravo Air example, our time ontology can be used to describe the existing input parameters, <code>DepartureDate</code>
          and <code>ArrivalDate</code>. We will change this to the more appropriate <code>DepartureTime</code> and <code>ArrivalTime</code>.
          We can define <code>DepartureTime</code> in the profile of the Bravo Air example (i.e. BravoAirProfile.owl)
          as: </p>
        <pre>profile:DepartureTime
      a       profile:ParameterDescription ;
      profile:parameterName
              DepartureTime ;
      profile:restrictedTo
              :<b>Instant</b> ;
      profile:referTo
              ba_process:outboundDate_In .</pre>
        <p><code>DepartureTime</code> is defined as <code>Instant</code>. With this definition, as we discussed in the
          previous datetime description section, an instance of <code>DepartureTime</code> can has either an <code>inXSDDateTime</code>
          property/relation pointing to a specific value of XML Schema datatype dateTime, say 2006-01-01T10:30:00-5:00,
          or an <code>inDateTime</code> object-property/relation pointing to an instance of <code>DateTimeDescription</code>
          class specifying a specific time, say 10:30am EST on 01/01/2006, Sunday. It would be the user’s decision to
          define the time in either way based on the trade-offs discussed in the previous section.</p>
        <h4>(Conditional) Output Parameters</h4>
        <p>In fact, there is much more that our time ontology can do to support OWL-S. In the Congo.com and Bravo Air
          examples, the time ontology is not used for any output parameters. However, in the real world many service
          outputs are time-related. For example, in the Congo.com example we can add two outputs that are very common in
          real world book-selling sites: process time and delivery duration.</p>
        <h4>Adding a <code>ProcessTime</code> output parameter</h4>
        <p><code>ProcessTime</code> is a conditional output parameter that specifies how long before the book will be
          ready for delivery, say, 24 hours, which depends on whether the book is in stock. In this use case, the
          process time is returned only if the book is in stock. It can be defined in the process model of the Congo.com
          example (i.e. CongoProcess.owl) as:</p>
        <pre>:ProcessTime
      a       owl:Class ;
      rdfs:subClassOf :Interval .

:fullCongoBuyProcessTime
      a       rdf:Property ;
      rdfs:subPropertyOf process:output ;
      rdfs:domain :FullCongoBuy ;
      rdfs:range       
	      [ a       owl:Class ;
      		rdfs:subClassOf process:ConditionalOutput ;
      		rdfs:subClassOf
              		[ a       owl:Restriction ;
                	owl:allValuesFrom :BookInStock ;
                	owl:onProperty process:coCondition
              		] ;
	      ] ;
      rdfs:subClassOf
              [ a       owl:Restriction ;
                owl:allValuesFrom :ProcessTime ;
                owl:onProperty process:coOutput
              ] .</pre>
        <p><code>ProcessTime</code> is defined as an interval, rather than a duration. As discussed previously, in our
          time ontology durations are properties of intervals. Thus to talk about a duration, i.e. a quantity of time,
          an interval must be defined first. This approach may look roundabout at first glance. However, the process
          time is not purely a quantity of time; it has a location on the time line. The beginning of the process time
          is the time the user places the order, and the end of the process time is the time the order is shipped out.
          An advantage of defining <code>ProcessTime</code> as an interval is that if the relationship among the order
          time, the shipping time, and the process time is known, any one of them (e.g. the shipping time) can be
          computed from the other two (e.g. the order time and the process time) by temporal arithmetic. </p>
        <h4>Adding a <code>DeliveryDuration</code> output parameter</h4>
        <p><code>DeliveryDuration</code> is a conditional output parameter that specifies how long it will take for the
          customer to receive the book after it is shipped out, which depends on the delivery type the customer selects.
          As defined in the process model of the Congo.com example (i.e. CongoProcess.owl), the current delivery types
          are FedExOneDay, FedEx2-3day, UPS, and OrdinaryMail. </p>
        <p>To add this output parameter may seem similar to the above <code>ProcessTime</code> example. However, since
          an instance of <code>Condition</code> is a logical formula that evaluates to true or false (see the comment
          with the definition of Condition [<a href="#PR-OS">PR-OS</a>]), <code>DeliveryType</code> cannot be directly
          used as a condition to determine the delivery duration. Thus one property and one condition are defined for
          each delivery type. </p>
        <p><code>DeliveryDuration</code> is defined with two boundaries: one <code>minDeliveryDuration</code> and one <code>maxDeliveryDuration</code>.
          For example, an order with the FedEx2-3day delivery type takes 2 to 3 days, so its min delivery duration is 2
          days, and its max delivery duration is 3 days. For the delivery duration of the order with FedExOneDay
          delivery type, the min and max delivery duration will both be 1 day. We can define <code>DeliveryDuration</code>
          in the process model of the Congo.com example (i.e. CongoProcess.owl) as:</p>
        <pre>:DeliveryDuration
      a       owl:Class ;
      rdfs:subClassOf
              [ a       owl:Restriction ;
                owl:cardinality 1 ;
                owl:onProperty :maxDeliveryDuration
              ] ;
      rdfs:subClassOf
              [ a       owl:Restriction ;
                owl:cardinality 1 ;
                owl:onProperty :minDeliveryDuration
              ] .

:maxDeliveryDuration
      a       rdf:Property ;
      rdfs:domain :DeliveryDuration ;
      rdfs:range :Interval .

:minDeliveryDuration
      a       rdf:Property ;
      rdfs:domain :DeliveryDuration ;
      rdfs:range :Interval .
</pre>
        <p>Both <code>minDeliveryDuration</code> and <code>maxDeliveryDuration</code> are defined as properties of <code>DeliveryDuration</code>.
          For the same reason discussed for the process time example, both properties use Interval as their ranges. The
          cardinality of 1 for both properties in the definition of <code>DeliveryDuration</code> indicates that an
          instance of <code>DeliveryDuration</code> must have one and only one property value for <code>minDeliveryDuration</code>
          and <code>maxDeliveryDuration</code> respectively. For example, in order to define delivery duration for
          FedEx2-3day, we have to first define a condition of FedEx2-3day being selected:</p>
        <pre>:FedEx2-3dayCondition
      a       owl:Class ;
      rdfs:subClassOf process:Condition .</pre>
        <p>Then we define an output property, called <code>deliverySelectFedEx2-3day</code> that is conditional on <code>FedEx2-3dayCondition</code>
          defined above:</p>
        <pre>:deliverySelectFedEx2-3day
      a       rdf:Property ;
      rdfs:subPropertyOf process:output ;      
      rdfs:domain :SpecifyDeliveryDetails ;
      rdfs:range 
      	      [ a       owl:Class ;
      	      	rdfs:subClassOf process:ConditionalOutput ;
      	      	rdfs:subClassOf
              	      	[ a       owl:Restriction ;
                      	owl:allValuesFrom :FedEx2-3dayDuration ;
                      	owl:onProperty process:coOutput
              	      	] ;

              	      	[ a       owl:Restriction ;
                      	owl:allValuesFrom :FedEx2-3dayCondition ;
                      	owl:onProperty process:coCondition
              ] .</pre>
        <p>This definition says that <code>deliverySelectFedEx2-3day</code> is a conditional output, and if <code>FedEx2-3dayCondition</code>
          is true, an instance of <code>FedEx2-3dayDuration</code> class will be the output. <code>FedEx2-3dayDuration</code>
          is not defined yet. In order to define it, we have to define its min delivery duration, i.e. 2 days, and max
          delivery duration, i.e. 3 days. Since the range of <code>minDeliveryDuration</code> and <code>maxDeliveryDuration</code>
          is <code>Interval</code>, intervals with specific durations need to be created first. For <code>FedEx2-3dayDuration</code>,
          we need to define <code>Interval2Days</code> and <code>Interval3Days</code> first as follows:</p>
        <pre>:Interval2Days
      a       owl:Class ;
      rdfs:subClassOf :Interval ;
      owl:subClassOf
              [ a       owl:Restriction ;
                owl:hasValue P2D ;
                owl:onProperty :durationDescriptionDataType
              ] .

:Interval3Days
      a       owl:Class ;
      rdfs:subClassOf :Interval ;
      owl:subClassOf
              [ a       owl:Restriction ;
                owl:hasValue P3D ;
                owl:onProperty :durationDescriptionDataType
              ] .</pre>
        <p>These two definitions use <code>durationDescriptionDataType</code>, a relatively simpler duration property
          of <code>Interval</code> using the XML Schmea datatype <code>duration</code> as its range. <code>P2D</code>
          and <code>P3D</code> are values of the XML Schema datatype <code>duration</code>, meaning 2 days and 3 days.</p>
        <p>Finally, <code>FedEx2-3dayDuration</code> restricts the value of <code>minDeliveryDuration</code> and <code>maxDeliveryDuration</code>
          to class <code>Interval2Days</code> and <code>Interval3Days</code> respectively as follows:</p>
        <pre>:FedEx2-3dayDuration
      a       owl:Class ;
      rdfs:subClassOf :DeliveryDuration ;
      rdfs:subClassOf
              [ a       owl:Restriction ;
                owl:allValuesFrom :Interval3Days ;
                owl:onProperty :maxDeliveryDuration
              ] ;
      rdfs:subClassOf
              [ a       owl:Restriction ;
                owl:allValuesFrom :Interval2Days ;
                owl:onProperty :minDeliveryDuration
              ] .</pre>
        <p>Properties to output delivery durations when the user selects other delivery types (FedExOneDay, UPS, and
          OrdinaryMail) can be defined similarly.</p>

      <h2>Time Zone Vocabulary</h2>
      <p class="note">This section unaltered from [<a href="#OWL-T">OWL-T</a>]. </p>
      <p class="issue"  data-number="127">(Was local Issue 12) The time zone ontology and vocabularies is less mature than the time ontology. It includes a
        taxonomy of jurisdictions (Region, PoliticalRegion, Country, State, Reservation, County, City) which does not
        cover all international practice. It refers to GMT, rather than UTC. It has fixed dates for daylight savings
        start and end, else uses a time-sequence ontology which is not provided. Appears to need more work. </p>
      <p id="timezones-owl">We have developed a time zone resource in OWL for the entire world, including three parts:
        the time zone ontology file [<a href="#TZ-ON">TZ-ON</a>], the US time zone instance file [<a href="#TZ-US">TZ-US</a>],
        and the world time zone instance file [<a href="#TZ-WO">TZ-WO</a>]. </p>
      <p>The time zone ontology links a preliminary geographic ontology with a time ontology. It defines the vocabulary
        about regions, political regions (countries, states, counties, reservations, and cities), time zones, daylight
        saving policies, and the relationships between these concepts. Its instances also link to other existing data on
        the Web, such as FIPS 55 county instances [<a href="#FIPS">FIPS</a>], and ISO country instances [<a href="#ISO-C"><span

            style="color: rgb(0, 0, 238);"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ISO-C</span></span></a>].</p>
      <p>It can handle all the usual time zone and daylight savings cases. For example, Los Angles uses PST, the time
        offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is -8 hours, and it observed daylight savings from April 2 to
        October 29 in 2006. But it handles unusual cases as well. For example, in Idaho the northern part is in the
        Pacific zone, the southern part in the Mountain. The city of West Wendover, Nevada is in the Mountain time zone,
        while the rest of Nevada is in the Pacific. </p>
      <section id="examples1">
        <h3>Use case examples</h3>
        <p id="codesyntax0">Suppose someone has a telecon scheduled for 6:00pm EST on November 5, 2006. You would like
          to make an appointment with him for 2:00pm PST on the same day, and expect the meeting to last 45 minutes.
          Will there be an overlap? In order to specify the facts about the telecon and the meeting and reason about the
          relation between them, a time zone ontology would be necessary to help a time ontology (e.g. OWL-Time) to
          resolve the time difference between EST and PST.</p>

        <p>Countries, states, counties, cities, and reservations are all subclass of political regions with different
          range types for the <code>hasParentRegion</code> property.<br>
          <br>
          For example, <code>Country</code> and <code>State</code> can be defined in OWL as:</p>
        <pre>:Country
      a       owl:Class ;
      rdfs:subClassOf :PoliticalRegion .</pre>
        <pre>:State
      a       owl:Class ;
      rdfs:subClassOf :PoliticalRegion ;
      owl:subClassOf
              [ a       owl:Restriction ;

               owl:allValuesFrom :Country                 
              ] .</pre>
        Time zones have two properties:
        <ul>
          <li><b>name</b>: at most one string. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><b>GMToffset</b>: an XML Schema duration between -12 and +14 hours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This can be defined in OWL as:</p>
        <pre>:TimeZone
      a       owl:Class ;
      rdfs:subClassOf
              [ a       owl:Restriction ;
                owl:maxCardinality 1 ;
                owl:onProperty :name
              ] ;
      rdfs:subClassOf
              [ a       owl:Restriction ;
                owl:maxCardinality 1 ;
                owl:onProperty :GMToffset
              ] .</pre>
        <p>We assume default reasoning is used for this ontology. When a political region lacks one of its properties,
          we will use the one from its parent region. Thus all political sub-regions of the United States get their <code>DaylightSavingsPolicy</code>
          values from that of the United States, provided their <code>observesDaylightSavingsTime</code> property is
          true. All counties in California get their <code>hasTimeZone</code> values from California, whereas the <code>hasTimeZone</code>
          value is specified for each county in Kentucky and not for the state as a whole, since it is split between the
          Eastern and Central time zones. When most of a region is in one time zone, and only some exceptional
          sub-regions are in different time zones or have different daylight savings time policies, we use <code>exceptionalRegion</code>
          to point to each exceptional sub-region, e.g. West Wendover, which is in the Mountain time zone, is an
          exception in Nevada, which is otherwise in the Pacific time zone. Here is the OWL code of Nevada and West
          Wendover in the US time zone instance file [<a href="#TZ-US">TZ-US</a>]:</p>
        <pre>:us-states:NV
      a       :State ;
      :hasParentRegion iso:US;
      :hasTimeZone :<b>PST</b> ;
      :observesDaylightSavingsTime true ;
      :<b>exceptionalRegion</b> :<b>NVWestWendoverCity</b> .

:NVWestWendoverCity
      a       :City ;
      :name "West Wendover City" ;
      :stateOf us-states:NV ;
      :hasTimeZone :MST ;
      owl:samelAs &lt;http://www.daml.org/2003/02/fips55/NV.owl#p83730&gt; ;
      .</pre>
        <p>When different parts of the same county are in different time zones, the <code>hasTimeZone</code> is not
          specified for the county. Instead the <code>hasTimeZone</code> is specified for each part with different time
          zones, and the <code>timeZonePart</code> property is used to point to the parts from the county instance,
          e.g. the two different time zone parts in Idaho County, Idaho. Here is the OWL encoding of Idaho County, Idaho
          in our US time zone instance file [<a href="#TZ-US">TZ-US</a>]:</p>
        <pre>:IDIdaho
      a       :County ;
      :name "Idaho County" ;
      :hasParentRegion us-states:ID ;
      :timeZonePart :IDIdahoPST , :IDIdahoMST ;
      owl:sameAs &lt;http://www.daml.org/2003/02/fips55/id.owl#c049&gt; ;
      .</pre>
        <code>DaylightSavingsPolicy</code> has one property:
        <ul>
          <li><b>lastUpdated</b>: the time that the daylight savings policy was updated. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><code>EnumeratedDaylightSavingsPolicy</code>, a subclass of <code>DaylightSavingsPolicy</code>, has the
          following properties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>DLSstartDate</b>: the date the region goes on daylight savings time. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><b>DLSendDate</b>: the date the region goes off daylight savings time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This can be defined in OWL as:</p>
        <pre>:EnumeratedDaylightSavingsPolicy
      a       owl:Class ;
      rdfs:subClassOf :DaylightSavingsPolicy ;
      rdfs:subClassOf
              [ a       owl:Restriction ;
                owl:maxCardinality 1 ;
                owl:onProperty :DLSendDate
              ] ;
      rdfs:subClassOf
              [ a       owl:Restriction ;
                owl:maxCardinality 1 ;
                owl:onProperty :DLSstartDate
              ] .</pre>
        <p><code>DLSstartDate</code> and <code>DLSendDate</code> properties have the range of xsd:date. In the current
          instance files, different daylight saving policies were only defined for year 2006 as instances of <code>EnumeratedDaylightSavingsPolicy</code>,
          e.g. <code>USA2006DLS</code> for the United States, and <code>EU2006DLS</code> for the European Union.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, a temporal aggregates ontology in OWL-Time can be used to describe the daylight saving
          policies. For example, in the US daylight saving starts on "the first Sunday of every April", which can be
          expressed in OWL as:</p>
        <pre>:tseq
      a       :TemporalSeq ;
      :hasTemporalAggregateDescription
              :firstSunEveryApril .</pre>
        <pre>:tseq-everyApril
      a       :TemporalSeq ;
      :hasTemporalAggregateDescription
              :everyApril .</pre>
        <pre>:everyApril
      a       :TemporalAggregateDescription ;
      :hasTemporalUnit
              :unitMonth ;
      :hasithTemporalUnit 4 .

:firstSunEveryApril
      a       :TemporalAggregateDescription ;
      :hasContextTemporalSeq
              :tseq-everyApril ;
      :hasContextTemporalUnit
              :unitMonth ;
      :hasithTemporalUnit 7 ;
      :hasTemporalUnit
              :unitDay ;
      :hasPosition 1 .</pre>
        <p>This defines the desired temporal sequence <code>tseq</code> of class <code>TemporalSeq</code> which has a
          <code>hasTemporalAggregateDescription</code> property that points to a temporal aggregate description <code>firstSunEveryApril</code>
          that describes the temporal sequence. In order to describe this two-layered temporal sequence ("the first
          Sunday" of "every April"), the outside layer ("every April"), i.e. the context temporal sequence (<code>tseq-everyApril</code>),
          needs to be defined first. This context temporal sequence also has its own <code>hasTemporalAggregateDescription</code>
          property that points to <code>everyApril</code> which describes that it is the every 4th (<code>hasithTemporalUnit</code>
          of 4) month (<code>hasTemporalUnit</code> of <code>unitMonth</code>). The desired temporal sequence is then
          defined as "the first (<code>hasPosition</code> of 1) Sunday (<code>hasithTemporalUnit</code> of 7 and <code>hasTemporalUnit</code>
          of <code>unitDayOfWeek</code>) of every April (<code>hasContextTemporalSeq</code> of <code>tseq-everyApril</code>
          and <code>hasContextTemporalUnit</code> of <code>unitMonth</code>)".</p>

        <h3>Anticipated Use</h3>
        <p>The expected input to the ontology is a location, e.g. a city, and the output will be its current time
          offset, say -6 hours, from the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).<br>
          <br>
          The ontology would be used as follows: given an input location, we first find in the ontology the lowest-level
          political region containing this location, say a county, then go up along the political region hierarchy based
          on the <code>hasParentRegion</code> property to the top of the hierarchy, usually a country. Along the path
          to the top, we get all the available information from each node (region) in order to calculate the time offset
          from the GMT. The information includes the time zone this location is in, whether it uses Daylight Savings
          (DLS) time, and if it does, what the start and end dates are. </p>
        <p>However, flexible inputs and more efficiency are supported by using the <code>exceptionalRegion</code> and <code>timeZonePart</code>
          properties, i.e. the location input does not have to be as detailed as the lowest-level political region,
          especially because usually only the information about what state it is in would be enough to calculate the
          time offset from the GMT for the input location. </p>
        <p>If the input only says it's a location of a state without specifying the county or city it is in, then we can
          first go to its state and see whether we can find all the information we need there, i.e. time zone and
          daylight savings information. If the state doesn't have any <code>exceptionalRegion</code>’s, then we don't
          need any more inputs for this location, and can safely go up along the political region hierarchy to the top
          of the hierarchy, e.g. the country US, and get all the information we need along the way to calculate the time
          offset from the GMT for this location. If the state does have any <code>exceptionalRegion</code>’s, however,
          we have to check each exceptional region to see whether this location is in it or not, at this checking phase,
          more detailed information about this location may be needed, i.e. which county/city/reservation it is in. If
          it's in an exceptional county that further has <code>timeZonePart</code>’s, then even more detailed
          information is needed from the input, i.e. which time zone part the location is in within this county. When
          reaching a sub-region with no <code>exceptionalRegion</code>’s or <code>timeZonePart</code>’s, we know for
          sure that no more input location information is needed and it's safe to go up along the political region
          hierarchy to the top, and get all the information we need to calculate the time offset from the GMT for this
          location. <br>
          <br>
          For example, suppose the input location is a location in West Wendover, Nevada, but at first we only know it's
          in Nevada (please see the OWL code [<a href="#ref-west-wen">in the previous section</a>]). In the ontology, we
          first find Nevada state, from which we see one exceptional region pointing to West Wendover City, then we ask
          for further input location information: which city is this location in? Say we get West Wendover City. Since
          it matches the exceptional region, we then go to the West Wendover City instance to get its time zone
          information, which is the Mountain time zone. Since there is no <code>exceptionalRegion</code>’s or <code>timeZonePart</code>’s
          in the West Wendover City instance, it's now safe for us to go up along the hierarchy to the top, the United
          States. Along the path, at Nevada State we learn this location uses DLS time, then at its parent region, the
          US, we learn the DLS policy used is USA2006DLS which specifies the start date of the DLS in 2006 is 04/02/2006
          and the end date is 10/29/2006. Based on our current time, e.g. 1:50pm on 09/06/2006, we know the current time
          offset from the GMT at this location is -7 hours. </p>
