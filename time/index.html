<section id="abstract">
<p>OWL-Time is an OWL-2 DL ontology of temporal concepts, for describing the temporal properties of
resources in the world or described in Web pages. The ontology provides a vocabulary for expressing facts about
topological (ordering) relations among instants and intervals, together with information about durations, and about
temporal position including date-time information. Time positions and durations may be expressed using either the conventional (Gregorian) calendar and clock, or using another temporal reference system such as Unix-time, geologic time, or different calendars.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The namespace for OWL-Time terms is <code>http://www.w3.org/2006/time#</code></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The suggested prefix for the OWL-Time namespace is <code>time</code></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The OWL-Time ontology is available <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/sdw/gh-pages/time/rdf/time.ttl">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">An ontology of individuals for the Gregorian calendar (months) is available <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/sdw/gh-pages/time/rdf/time-gregorian.ttl">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>For OGC -</strong> This is a Public Draft of a document prepared by the Spatial Data on the Web Working Group
	(<a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sdwwg">SDWWG</a>)
— a joint W3C-OGC project (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/charter">charter</a>).
The document is prepared following W3C conventions. Comments regarding this document are welcome - please submit them in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sdw/issues">issue tracker</a>. Recipients of this document are invited to submit, with their comments, notification of any relevant patent rights of which they are aware and to provide supporting documentation. </p>

<p>New classes and properties are introduced in this revision of OWL-Time. The new elements primarily relate to relaxing the limitation that time position uses only the Gregorian Calendar, and are placed in a logical hierarchy in relation to the original elements. While there is less implementation evidence for these than the elements from the 2006 version, the new elements are essential to satisfying key requirements in the revision. </p>
<p>However, a small number of other new elements merit additional explanation: </p>
<ol>
  <li><code><a href="#time:hasXSDDuration">:hasXSDDuration</a></code> allows use of the compact xsd:duration element to describe the extent of a temporal entity. This complements existing predicates used with XSD datatypes, and was an inexplicable omission from the original ontology. </li>
  <li><code><a href="#time:MonthOfYear">:MonthOfYear</a></code> and <code><a href="#time:monthOfYear">:monthOfYear</a></code> complement :DayOfWeek and :dayOfWeek to support vernacular names for months as well as days. </li>
  <li><code><a href="#time:hasTime">:hasTime</a></code> is a completely generic predicate for associating a temporal entity with anything. A number of generic predicates suitable for use directly in applications were requested, but in general were deemed undesirable in an ontology dealing with the description of time elements rather than their use. This one only was included for users unwilling or unable to define their own semantics. </li>
</ol>

<section id="motivation" class ="informative">
<h2>Motivation and background</h2>
<p>Temporal information is important in most real world applications. 
For example, the date is always part of an online order. 
When you rent a car it is for specific dates. 
Events in the world occur at specific times and usually have a finite duration. 
Transactions occur in a sequence, with the current state of a system depending on the exact history of all the transactions. 
Knowledge of the temporal relationships between transactions, events, travel and orders is often critical. 
OWL-Time has been developed in response to this need, 
for describing the temporal properties of any resource denoted using a web identifier (URI), 
including web-pages and real-world things if desired. 
It focusses particularly on temporal ordering relationships. 
While these are implicit in all temporal descriptions, OWL-Time provides specific predicates to support, or to make explicit the results of, reasoning over the order or sequence of temporal entities. </p>
<p>There is a great deal of relevant existing work, some very closely related. 
ISO 8601 [[iso8601]] provides a basis for encoding time position and extent in a character string, using the most common modern calendar-clock system. 
Datatypes in XML Schema [[xmlschema11-2]] use a subset of the ISO 8601 format in order to pack multi-element values into a compact literal. 
Functions and operators on durations, and on dates and times, encoded in these ways are available in XPath and XQuery [[xpath-functions-31]]. 
XSLT [[xslt20]] also provides formatting functions for times and dates, with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/#format-date">explicit support for the specified language, calendar and country</a>.  
Some of the XML Schema datatypes are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-quick-reference/#Built-in_Datatypes">built-in to OWL2</a> [[owl2-quick-reference]], so the XPath and XQuery functions may be used on basic OWL data. </p>
<p>OWL-Time makes use of these encodings, but also provides representations in which the elements of a date and time are put into separately addressable resources, which can help with queries and reasoning applications. 
OWL-Time also supports other representations of temporal position and duration, including temporal coordinates (scaled position on a continuous temporal axis) and ordinal times (named positions or periods), as well as relaxing the expectation from the original version that dates must use the Gregorian calendar. 
However, OWL-Time has a particular focus on ordering relations ("temporal topology"), which is not supported explicitly in any of the date-time encodings. </p>
<p>A first-order logic axiomatization of the core of this ontology is available in [[hp-04]].
This document presents the OWL encodings of the ontology, with some additions. </p>
<p>This version of OWL-Time was developed in the Spatial Data on the Web Working Group (a joint activity involving W3C and the Open Geospatial Consortium). 
The ontology is based on the draft by Hobbs and Pan [[owl-time-20060927]], incorporating modifications proposed by Cox [[co-15]] to support more general temporal positions, along with other minor improvements. 
The substantial changes are listed in the <a href="#changes">change-log</a>.
The specification document has been completely re-written. </p>

<h2>Principles and vocabulary overview</h2>

<section id="topology">
<h3>Topological Temporal Relations</h3>
<p>The basic structure of the ontology is based on an algebra of binary relations on intervals 
(e.g., meets, overlaps, during) developed by Allen [[al-84]], [[af-97]] for
representing qualitative temporal information, and to address the problem of reasoning about such information.
</p>
<p>The ontology starts with a class <code><a href="#time:TemporalEntity">:TemporalEntity</a></code> with properties <code><a href="#time:hasBeginning">:hasBeginning</a></code> and <code><a href="#time:hasEnd">:hasEnd</a></code> that link to the temporal instants that define its limits, and <code><a href="#time:hasTemporalDuration">:hasTemporalDuration</a></code> to describe its extent. 
There are two subclasses: <code><a href="#time:Interval">:Interval</a></code>
and <code><a href="#time:Instant">:Instant</a></code>, and they are the only two subclasses of <code><a href="#time:TemporalEntity">:TemporalEntity</a></code>. 
Intervals are, intuitively, things with extent. 
Instants are, intuitively, point-like in that they have no interior points, but it is generally safe to think of an instant as an interval with zero length, where the beginning and end are the same. </p>
<p>This idea - that time intervals are the more general case and time instants are just a limited specialization - is the first key contribution of Allen's analysis. </p>
<p>The class <code><a href="#time:Interval">:Interval</a></code> has one subclass <code><a href="#time:ProperInterval">:ProperInterval</a></code>, which
corresponds with the common understanding of intervals, in that the beginning and end are distinct, and whose
membership is therefore disjoint from <code><a href="#time:Instant">:Instant</a></code>. </p>

<figure> <img title="Temporal Entity and sub-classes" alt="UML-style diagram of temporal entity classes" src="./images/TemporalEntity.png" width="600">
<figcaption>Core model of temporal entities.</figcaption> </figure>

<p>The class <code><a href="#time:ProperInterval">:ProperInterval</a></code> also has one subclass, <code><a href="#time:DateTimeInterval">:DateTimeInterval</a></code>.  
The position and extent of a <code><a href="#time:DateTimeInterval">:DateTimeInterval</a></code> is an element in a 
<code><a href="#time:GeneralDateTimeDescription">:GeneralDateTimeDescription</a></code>. </p>

<p>Relations between intervals are the critical logic provided by Allen's analysis, and implemented in the ontology. 
These can be defined in a relatively straightforward fashion in terms of <code><a href="#time:before">:before</a></code> and identity on the beginning and end points. 
The thirteen elementary relations shown below are the second key contribution of Allen's analysis. 
These support unambiguous expression of all possible relations between temporal entities, which allows the computation of any relative position or sequence.
Note that the standard interval calculus assumes all intervals are proper, so their beginning and end are different. </p>

<figure> <img style="width: 545px; height: 322px;" title="Allen's Interval Relations" alt="Schematic of Interval Relations"
src="./images/IntervalRelations.png"> 
<figcaption>Thirteen elementary possible relations between time periods [[af-97]].  </figcaption> </figure>

<p>Two additional relations: <code>In</code> (the union of <code>During</code>, <code>Starts</code> and <code>Finishes</code>) and <code>Disjoint</code> (the union of <code>Before</code> and <code>After</code>) are not shown in the figure but are included in the ontology. </p>

<p>The properties <code><a href="#time:hasTemporalDuration">:hasTemporalDuration</a></code>, <code><a href="#time:hasBeginning">:hasBeginning</a></code> and <code><a href="#time:hasEnd">:hasEnd</a></code>, together with a fourth generic property <code><a href="#time:hasTime">:hasTime</a></code>, support the association of temporal information with any temporal entity, such as an activity or event, or other entity. 
These provide a standard way to attach time information to things, which may be used directly in applications if suitable, or specialized if needed. </p>

</section>

<section id="trs-clock-calendar">
<h3>Temporal reference systems, clocks, calendars</h3>

<p>The duration of a TemporalEntity may be given using the datatype <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#duration">xsd:duration</a></code> and the position of an Instant may be given using the datatype <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dateTimeStamp">xsd:dateTimeStamp</a></code>, which is built in to OWL 2 [[owl2-syntax]]. 
These both use the conventional notions of temporal periods (years, months, weeks ... seconds), the Gregorian calendar, and the 24-hour clock. 
The lexical representations use [[iso8601]] style notation, but ignoring leap seconds, which are explicitly mandated by the international standard. </p>

<p>While this satisfies most web applications, many other calendars and temporal reference systems are used in particular cultural and scholarly contexts. 
For example, the Julian calendar was used throughout Europe until the 16<sup>th</sup> century, and is still used for computing key dates in some orthodox Christian communities. 
Lunisolar (e.g. Hebrew) and lunar (e.g. Islamic) calendars are currently in use in some communities, and many similar have been used historically. 
Ancient Chinese calendars as well as the French revolutionary calendar used 10-day weeks.  
In scientific and technical applications, Julian date counts the number of days since the beginning of 4713 BCE, and Loran-C, Unix and GPS time are based on seconds counted from a specified origin in 1958, 1970 and 1980, respectively, with GPS time represented using a pair of numbers for week number plus seconds into week. 
Archaeological and geological applications use chronometric scales based on years counted backwards from ‘the present’ (defined as 1950 for radiocarbon dating [[rc-14]]), or using named periods associated with specified correlation markers ([[cr-05]], [[cr-14]], [[mf-13]]).
Dynastic calendars (counting years within eras defined by the reign of a monarch or dynasty) were used in many cultures. In order to support these more general applications, the representation of temporal position and duration must be flexible, and annotated with the <em>temporal reference system </em>in use. </p>
<p>A set of ordered intervals (e.g. named dynasties, geological periods, geomagnetic reversals, tree rings) can
make a simple form of temporal reference system that supports logical reasoning, known as an <em>ordinal
temporal reference system </em> [[iso19108]]. </p>
<p>Measurement of duration needs a <em>clock</em>. In its most general form a clock is just a regularly
repeating physical event ('tick') and a counting mechanism for the 'ticks'. These counts may be used to
logically relate two events and to calculate a duration between the events.</p>
<p>A <em>calendar </em>is a set of algorithms that enables clock counts to be converted into practical
everyday dates and times related to the movement of astronomical bodies (day, month, year). </p>
<p class="note">As astronomically based calendars try to fit inconvenient durations into a usable regular system of counting cycles, 'intercalations' are often used to re-align the calendar's repeating patterns with astronomical events. These intercalations may be of different durations depending on the calendar, such as leap seconds, leap days, or even a group of days. Leap days are explicit and leap seconds implicit in the Gregorian calendar, which underlies the model used in several classes in OWL-Time. A general treatment of intercalations is beyond the scope of this ontology. </p>
<p>For many purposes it is convenient to make temporal calculations in terms of clock durations that exceed
everyday units such as days, weeks, months and years, using a representation of temporal position in a
<em>temporal coordinate system</em> [[iso19108]], or <em>temporal coordinate reference system</em> [[iso-19111-2019]], [[ogc-topic-2]],
i.e. on a number line with a specified origin, such as Julian date, or Unix time.
This may be converted to calendar units when necessary for human consumption. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, in practice much temporal information is not well-defined, in that there may be no clear
statement about the assumed underlying calendar and clock. </p>
</section>

<section id="time-position">
<h3>Time position</h3>
<p>OWL 2 has two built-in datatypes relating to time: <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dateTime">xsd:dateTime</a></code> and <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dateTimeStamp">xsd:dateTimeStamp</a></code> [[owl2-syntax]]. Other XSD types such as <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#date">xsd:date</a></code>, <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#gYear">xsd:gYear</a></code> and <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#gYearMonth">xsd:gYearMonth</a></code> [[xmlschema11-2]] are also commonly used in OWL applications.
These provide for a compact representation of time positions using the conventional Gregorian calendar and
24-hour clock, with timezone offset from UTC.</p>
<p>Four classes in the ontology support an explicit description of temporal position. 
<code><a href="#time:TemporalPosition">:TemporalPosition</a></code> is the common super-class, with a property <code><a href="#time:hasTRS">:hasTRS</a></code> to indicate the temporal reference system in use. 
<code><a href="#time:TimePosition">:TimePosition</a></code> has properties to alternatively describe the position using a number (i.e. a temporal coordinate), or a nominal value (e.g. geologic time period, dynastic name, archeological era). 
<code><a href="#time:GeneralDateTimeDescription">:GeneralDateTimeDescription</a></code> has a set of properties to specify a date-time using calendar and clock elements. 
Its subclass <code><a href="#time:DateTimeDescription">:DateTimeDescription</a></code> fixes the temporal reference system to the Gregorian calendar.  </p>

<figure> <img title="Temporal Position" alt="UML-style diagram of classes for temporal position" src="./images/TemporalPosition.png" width="600">
<figcaption>Classes for temporal position.</figcaption> </figure>

<p>Following Allen's first key idea described above, even a time position has a finite extent, corresponding to the precision or <em>temporal unit </em>used. Thus, a <code><a href="#time:GeneralDateTimeDescription">:GeneralDateTimeDescription</a></code>
or <code><a href="#time:DateTimeDescription">:DateTimeDescription</a></code> has a duration corresponding to the value of its <code><a href="#time:unitType">:unitType</a></code>.</p>

</section>

<section id="duration">
<h3>Duration </h3>
<p>The duration of an interval (or temporal sequence) can have many different descriptions. An interval can be 1
day 2 hours, or 26 hours, or 1560 minutes, and so on. It is useful to be able to talk about these descriptions
in a convenient way as independent objects, and to talk about their equivalences. The extent of an interval can be 
given using multiple duration descriptions or individual durations (e.g., 2 days, 48 hours) , but these must all describe the same amount of time. </p>
<p>Four classes support the description of the duration of an entity. 
<code><a href="#time:TemporalDuration">:TemporalDuration</a></code> is the common super-class.
<code><a href="#time:Duration">:Duration</a></code> has properties to describe the duration using a scaled number (i.e. a temporal quantity). 
<code><a href="#time:GeneralDurationDescription">:GeneralDurationDescription</a></code> has a set of properties to specify a duration using calendar and clock elements, the definitions of which are given in the associated TRS description. 
Its subclass <code><a href="#time:DurationDescription">:DurationDescription</a></code> fixes the temporal reference system to the Gregorian calendar, so the <code><a href="#time:hasTRS">:hasTRS</a></code> property may be omitted on individuals from this class. </p>
<p><code><a href="#time:TemporalUnit">:TemporalUnit</a></code> is a standard duration which is used to scale a length of time, and to capture its granularity or precision. </p>

<figure> <img title="Temporal Duration" alt="UML representation of Temporal Duration and sub-classes" src="./images/TemporalDuration.png" width="600"> 
<figcaption>Classes for temporal duration.</figcaption> </figure>

<p>We use two different sets of properties for <code><a href="#time:GeneralDateTimeDescription">:GeneralDateTimeDescription</a></code> or <code><a href="#time:DateTimeDescription">:DateTimeDescription</a></code>,
and <code><a href="#time:GeneralDurationDescription">:GeneralDurationDescription</a></code> or <code><a href="#time:DurationDescription">:DurationDescription</a></code>, because their ranges are
different. For example, <code><a href="#time:year">:year</a></code> (in <code><a href="#time:DateTimeDescription">:DateTimeDescription</a></code>) has a range of <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#gYear">xsd:gYear</a></code> which is a position in the Gregorian calendar,
while <code><a href="#time:years">:years</a></code> (in <code><a href="#time:DurationDescription">:DurationDescription</a></code>) has a range of <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#decimal">xsd:decimal</a></code>
so that you can say "duration of 2.5 years".</p>

<p>The class <code><a href="#time:DateTimeInterval">:DateTimeInterval</a></code> is a subclass of <code><a href="#time:ProperInterval">:ProperInterval</a></code>. It enables compact representation of an interval corresponding to a single element in a date-time description (i.e. a specified year, month, week, day, hour, minute, second). 
The property <code><a href="#time:hasDateTimeDescription">:hasDateTimeDescription</a></code> describes the interval.</p>

<p class="note"><code><a href="#time:DateTimeInterval">:DateTimeInterval</a></code> can only be used for an interval whose limits coincide with a date-time element aligned to the calendar and timezone indicated.
For example, while both have a duration of one day, the 24-hour interval beginning at midnight at the beginning of 8 May in Central Europe can be expressed as a <code><a href="#time:DateTimeInterval">:DateTimeInterval</a></code>, but the 24-hour interval starting at 1:30pm cannot. </p>

Datatypes [[xmlschema11-2]], except that the calendar is not specified in advance, but is provided
through the value of the <code><a href="#time:hasTRS">:hasTRS</a></code> property (defined above). </p>
<p>Some combinations of properties are redundant. For example, within a specified :year if <code><a href="#time:dayOfYear">:dayOfYear</a></code> is provided then <code><a href="#time:day">:day</a></code> and <code><a href="#time:month">:month</a></code> can be computed, and vice versa. 
Individual values SHOULD be consistent with each other and the calendar, indicated through the value of the <code><a href="#time:hasTRS">:hasTRS</a></code> property.</p>
<p>Two additional properties <code><a href="#time:week">:week</a></code> and <code><a href="#time:dayOfYear">:dayOfYear</a></code> allow for the numeric value of the week or day relative to the year. 
The property <code><a href="#time:dayOfWeek">:dayOfWeek</a></code> provides the name of the day, and the property <code><a href="#time:monthOfYear">:monthOfYear</a></code> provides the name of the month. </p>

<p>An ontology for time zone descriptions was described in [[owl-time-20060927]] and provided as RDF in a separate namespace <code>tzont:</code>.
However, that ontology was incomplete in scope, and the example datasets were selective.

</div>
<div class="note">
	<p>A designated timezone is associated with a geographic region. However, for a particular region the offset from UTC often varies seasonally, and the dates of the changes may vary from year to year. The timezone designation usually changes for the different seasons (e.g. Australian Eastern Standard Time vs. Australian Eastern Daylight Time). Furthermore, the offset for a timezone may change over longer timescales, though its designation might not. </p>

<p class="note">Using <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dateTime">xsd:dateTime</a></code> in this place means that the duration of the interval is implicit: it corresponds to the length of the smallest non-zero element of the date-time literal. However, this rule cannot be used for intervals whose duration is more than one rank smaller than the starting time - e.g. the first minute or second of a day, the first hour of a month, or the first day of a year. In these cases the desired interval cannot be distinguished from the interval corresponding to the next rank up. Because of this essential ambiguity, use of this property is not recommended and it is deprecated. </p>

<h3>DateTimeDescription vs dateTime</h3>
<p>The following example illustrates the difference between using <code><a href="#time:DateTimeDescription">:DateTimeDescription</a></code> and using
the XML datatype <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dateTimeStamp">xsd:dateTimeStamp</a></code>. An instant that represents the start of a meeting, called <code>ex:meetingStart</code>,
happens at 10:30am AEST on 12 Apr 2017 can be expressed using both <code><a href="#time:inXSDDateTimeStamp">:inXSDDateTimeStamp</a></code> and <code><a href="#time:inDateTime">:inDateTime</a></code>
in OWL as:</p>
<pre>ex:meetingStart
  a                    :Instant ;
  :inDateTime          ex:meetingStartDescription ;
  :inXSDDateTimeStamp  2017-04-12T10:30:00+10:00 .

ex:meetingStartDescription
  a             :DateTimeDescription ;
  :unitType     :unitMinute ;
  :minute       30 ;
  :hour         10 ;
  :day          "---12"^^xsd:gDay ;
  :dayOfWeek    :Wednesday ;
  :dayOfYear    102 ;
  :week         15 ;
  :month        "--04"^^xsd:gMonth ;
  :monthOfYear  greg:April ;
  :timeZone     &lt;https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aest&gt; ;
  :year         "2017"^^xsd:gYear .</pre>

<p>It is much more concise to use the XML Schema datatype <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dateTimeStamp">xsd:dateTimeStamp</a></code>.
However, using <code><a href="#time:DateTimeDescription">:DateTimeDescription</a></code> more information can be included directly in a message, such as the "week", "day of week" and "day of year".
In the example we can also see that 12/04/2017 is a Wednesday, the month is April, it is the 102<sup>nd</sup> day of the year, and in the 15<sup>th</sup> week of the year.
Since each field of <code><a href="#time:DateTimeDescription">:DateTimeDescription</a></code> is separate no computation is required to get the values of these fields for use in reasoning.
However, since some calendars, such as religious observationally-based ones, cannot be algorithmically calculated explicit assertion of values for elements of the calendar is required.</p>
<p>The <code><a href="#time:timeZone">:timeZone</a></code> property points to a definition of Australian Eastern Standard Time. </p>

<section id="different-TRS">
<h3>Use of temporal reference systems</h3>
<p>The use of different temporal reference systems for the same absolute time is illustrated in the following
examples. Abby's birthday is an <code><a href="#time:Instant">:Instant</a></code> whose position may be expressed using the conventional
XSD <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dateTimeStamp">xsd:dateTimeStamp</a></code> type as <code>2001-05-23T08:20:00+08:00</code>:</p>
<pre>ex:AbbyBirthday
  a               :Instant ;
  :inDateTime     ex:AbbyBirthdayHebrew ;
  :inTimePosition ex:AbbyBirthdayUnix ;
  rdfs:label      "Abby's birthdate"^^xsd:string ;
  :inDateTime     ex:AbbyBirthdayGregorian ;
  :inXSDDateTimeStamp  "2001-05-23T08:20:00+08:00"^^xsd:dateTimeStamp ;
.</pre>
<p>Using the <code><a href="#time:DateTimeDescription">:DateTimeDescription</a></code> class, the elements of the date and time using the Gregorian
Calendar are split out into separate properties: </p>
<pre>ex:AbbyBirthdayGregorian
  a           	:DateTimeDescription ;
  :day        	"---23"^^xsd:gDay ;
  :dayOfWeek  	:Wednesday ;
  :dayOfYear 	"143"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ;
  :hour       	"8"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ;
  :minute     	"20"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ;
  :month      	"--05"^^xsd:gMonth ;
  :monthOfYear 	greg:May ;
  :timeZone   	&lt;https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/awst&gt; ;
  :unitType   	:unitMinute ;
  :year       	"2001"^^xsd:gYear ;
.</pre>
<p>The <code><a href="#time:GeneralDateTimeDescription">:GeneralDateTimeDescription</a></code> class may be used to express the same date using the Hebrew
calendar: </p>
<pre>ex:AbbyBirthdayHebrew
  a         	:GeneralDateTimeDescription ;
  :day      	"---01"^^:generalDay ;
  :hasTRS   	&lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hebrew_calendar&gt; ;
  :month    	"--03"^^:generalMonth ;
  :monthOfYear 	ex:Sivan ;
  :year     	"5761"^^:generalYear ;
  :unitType 	:unitDay ;
.</pre>
<p>The <code><a href="#time:TimePosition">:TimePosition</a></code> class may be used to express the same position in Unix time (also known as Posix time or Epoch time) (i.e.
the number of seconds since the beginning of 1st January 1970): </p>
<pre>ex:AbbyBirthdayUnix
  a                 :TimePosition ;
  :hasTRS           &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unix_time&gt; ;
  :numericPosition  990577200 ;
  rdfs:label        "Abby's birthdate in Unix time"^^xsd:string ;
.</pre>
<p>Each of these examples refers to either a temporal reference system or time zone described externally, using its URI. RDF representations are available from DBPedia (e.g. <a href="http://dbpedia.org/data/Unix_time.n3">http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unix_time</a>) though these do not have specific time semantics. </p>
<p>Similar to the way that <code><a href="#time:DateTimeDescription">:DateTimeDescription</a></code> is a derived from <code><a href="#time:GeneralDateTimeDescription">:GeneralDateTimeDescription</a></code> by fixing the <code><a href="#time:TRS">:TRS</a></code> to the Gregorian system, a specialized class <code>UnixTime</code> may be derived from <code><a href="#time:TimePosition">:TimePosition</a></code> by fixing the value of its reference system to the Unix time system:</p>
<pre>ex:UnixTime
  rdfs:subClassOf time:TimePosition ;
  rdfs:subClassOf [
      rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
      owl:hasValue &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unix_time&gt; ;
      owl:onProperty time:hasTRS ;
    ] ;

<section id="temporal-precision">
<h3>Temporal precision</h3>
<p>For the purposes of radiocarbon dating (which is the technique used in geological age determination for
materials up to around 60,000 years old) 'the Present' is conventionally fixed at 1950 [[rc-14]].
This can be described as an individual <code><a href="#time:Instant">:Instant</a></code>, with its position expressed using any of the
three alternatives: </p>
<pre>geol:Present
  a :Instant ;
  :inDateTime [
    a :DateTimeDescription ;
    :unitType :unitYear ;
    :year "1950"^^xsd:gYear ;
  ] ;
  :inTimePosition [
    a :TimePosition ;
    :hasTRS &lt;<a href="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/ChronometricGeologicTime">http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/ChronometricGeologicTime</a>&gt; ;
    :numericPosition 0.0 ;
  ] ;
  :inXSDDateTimeStamp "1950-01-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTimeStamp ;
  rdfs:label "The present"^^xsd:string ;
.</pre>
<p>Expressed using <code><a href="#time:DateTimeDescription">:DateTimeDescription</a></code> the <code><a href="#time:unitType">:unitType</a></code> 
- which determines the precision - 
is set to <code><a href="#time:unitYear">:unitYear</a></code>, and only the <code><a href="#time:year">:year</a></code> element is provided in the value.
The TRS value is not provided explicitly, as it is fixed in the ontology description to <a href="http://www.opengis.net/def/uom/ISO-8601/0/Gregorian">http://www.opengis.net/def/uom/ISO-8601/0/Gregorian</a>.
In the <code><a href="#time:TimePosition">:TimePosition</a></code> variant, the TRS is given as 
<a href="http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/ChronometricGeologicTime">http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/ChronometricGeologicTime</a>
which has units of millions of years, starting from the present, positive backwards.
For the value expressed using <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#dateTimeStamp">xsd:dateTimeStamp</a></code> the
position within the year is set arbitrarily to midnight at the beginning of 1st January. 
This level of precision in this case is spurious, but is required to satisfy the lexical pattern of the datatype.</p>

<p>Since the <code><a href="#time:numericPosition">:numericPosition</a></code>, <code><a href="#time:second">:second</a></code> properties have the datatype of <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#decimal">xsd:decimal</a></code>, the position of a <code><a href="#time:Instant">:Instant</a></code> or the duration of a <code><a href="#time:TemporalEntity">:TemporalEntity</a></code> may be represented with a precision of fractions of seconds if required. For example, a database timestamp with a precision of milliseconds can be expressed as follows: </p>

<pre>ex:DatabaseTimeStamp
  a :Instant ;
  :inXSDDateTimeStamp "2015-11-01T17:58:16.102Z"^^xsd:dateTimeStamp ;
  :inDateTime [
      a :DateTimeDescription ;
      :day "---01"^^xsd:gDay ;
      :hour "17"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ;
      :minute "58"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ;
      :month "--11"^^xsd:gMonth ;
      :second 16.102 ;
      :timeZone &lt;http://dbpedia.org/page/Coordinated_Universal_Time&gt; ;
      :year "2015"^^xsd:gYear ;
    ] ;
  :inDateTime [
      a ex:GPSTime ;
      :second 64696.102 ;
      :week "1834"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ;
    ] ;
.</pre>

<p>where <code>ex:GPSTime</code> specializes <code><a href="#time:GeneralDateTimeDescription">:GeneralDateTimeDescription</a></code> by setting the <code><a href="#time:unitType">:unitType</a></code> to <code><a href="#time:unitSecond">:unitSecond</a></code>, the <code><a href="#time:hasTRS">:hasTRS</a></code> to the GPS timekeeping system, and suppressing all other properties except for <code><a href="#time:week">:week</a></code> and <code><a href="#time:second">:second</a></code>:</p>

<h3>iCalendar</h3>
<p>iCalendar [[rfc5545]] is a widely supported standard for personal data interchange. It provides
the definition of a common format for openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling information across the
Internet. The representation of temporal concepts in this time ontology can be straightforwardly mapped to
iCalendar. For example, duration of 15 days, 5 hours and 20 seconds is represented in iCalendar as P15DT5H0M20S,
which can be represented in the time ontology as:</p>
<pre>:hasDurationDescription
  a         :DurationDescription ;
  :seconds  20 ;
  :hours    5 ;
  :days     15 .
</pre> 
<p>The <a href="https://icalendar.org/">iCalendar homepage</a> features the example of Abraham Lincoln's birthday as celebrated in 2008. 
This may be represented in multiple ways using OWL-Time, including the following.</p>

<h3>Geologic timescale</h3>
<p>The geologic timescale is defined as a set of named intervals arranged in a hierarchy, such that there is
only one subdivision of the intervals of each rank (e.g. 'Era') by a set of intervals of the next rank (in
this case 'Period') [[cr-05]]. Since the relative ordering is well-defined this graph can
therefore serve as an ordinal temporal reference system. Fig. 5 shows how the geologic timescale can be
expressed as a set of <code><a href="#time:ProperInterval">:ProperInterval</a></code>s related to each other using only <code><a href="#time:intervalMetBy">:intervalMetBy</a></code>, <code><a href="#time:intervalStartedBy">:intervalStartedBy</a></code>,
<code><a href="#time:intervalFinishedBy">:intervalFinishedBy</a></code>. Many other interval relationships follow logically from the ones shown (for
example 'Neogene Period' <code><a href="#time:intervalDuring">:intervalDuring</a></code> 'Cenozoic Era') but the ones shown are sufficient to describe
the full topology. </p>

<figcaption>Part of the geologic timescale formalized as ProperIntervals, with ordering relationships
described using the predicates defined in this ontology.</figcaption> </figure>
<p> For example, the 'Archean Eon' is a <code><a href="#time:ProperInterval">:ProperInterval</a></code> described as follows:</p>
<pre>geol:Archean
  rdf:type            :ProperInterval ;
  :hasBeginning       geol:BaseArchean ;
  :hasEnd             geol:BaseProterozoic ;
  :intervalMeets      geol:Proterozoic ;
  :intervalMetBy      geol:Hadean ;
  rdfs:label          "Archean Eon"^^xsd:string ;
.</pre>
<p>The beginning of the Archean Eon is an <code><a href="#time:Instant">:Instant</a></code>, described as follows:</p>
<pre>geol:BaseArchean
  rdf:type :Instant ;
  :inTimePosition [
    rdf:type          :TimePosition ;
    :hasTRS           &lt;http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/ChronometricGeologicTime&gt; ;
    :numericPosition  "4000"^^xsd:decimal ;
  ] ;
  rdfs:label "Base of Archean Eon"^^xsd:string ;
. </pre>
<p>Note that the position of this <code><a href="#time:Instant">:Instant</a></code> is specified using a <code><a href="#time:TimePosition">:TimePosition</a></code>, which
is a numeric value relative to the temporal coordinate system indicated as the value of the <code><a href="#time:hasTRS">:hasTRS</a></code> property.

<h3>A Use Case for Scheduling</h3>
<!--        <p class="note">This example carried over from [[owl-time-20060927]]. </p> -->
<p id="examples0">Suppose someone has a telecon scheduled for 6:00pm EST on November 5, 2006. You would like to
make an appointment with him for 2:00pm PST on the same day, and expect the meeting to last 45 minutes.
Will there be an overlap? </p>
<p>In this use case we can specify the facts about the telecon and the meeting using our ontology in OWL that
will allow a temporal reasoner to determine whether there is a conflict:</p>
<pre>ex:telecon
  a             :Interval ;
  :hasBeginning ex:teleconStart .

ex:meeting
  a                       :Interval ;
  :hasBeginning           ex:meetingStart ;
  :hasDurationDescription ex:meetingDuration .

ex:teleconStart
  a               :Instant ;
  :inXSDDateTimeStamp  "2006-11-05T18:00:00-5:00"^^xsd:dateTimeStamp .

ex:meetingStart
  a               :Instant ;
  :inXSDDateTimeStamp  "2006-11-05T14:00:00-8:00"^^xsd:dateTimeStamp .

ex:meetingDuration
  a         :DurationDescription ;
  :minutes  45 .
</pre>
<p>The telecon and the meeting are defined as intervals. <code><a href="#time:hasBeginning">:hasBeginning</a></code> is used for specifying the
start times of the meetings. The datetimes are specified using <code><a href="#time:inXSDDateTimeStamp">:inXSDDateTimeStamp</a></code>. The duration of
the meeting is specified using the <code><a href="#time:DurationDescription">:DurationDescription</a></code> class.</p>

<h3>Alignment of PROV-O with OWL-Time</h3>

       <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/">PROV</a> is a process-flow model. The base class <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Activity">Activity</a> denotes things that occur over a period of time, and act upon or with entities. Activities are ordered within a provenance trace. Thus, an alignment with OWL-Time is natural. </p>
      <p>The PROV-O classes <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Activity">prov:Activity</a></code> and <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#InstantaneousEvent">prov:InstantaneousEvent</a></code> may be conceived as sub-classes of <code><a href="#time:TemporalEntity">:TemporalEntity</a></code> and <code><a href="#time:Instant">:Instant</a></code> respectively.</p>
  
      <pre>prov:Activity           rdfs:subClassOf    time:TemporalEntity .
prov:InstantaneousEvent rdfs:subClassOf    time:Instant .</pre>

<p>The <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#atTime">prov:atTime</a></code> property of an <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#InstantaneousEvent">prov:InstantaneousEvent</a></code> is directly related to <code><a href="#time:inXSDDateTime">:inXSDDateTime</a></code>.</p>

<pre>prov:atTime             rdfs:subPropertyOf time:inXSDDateTime .</pre>


<p>However, the Activity start and end properties require a property chain axiom, because the beginning and end of a <code><a href="#time:TemporalEntity">:TemporalEntity</a></code> are <code><a href="#time:Instant">:Instants</a></code> rather than compact <code>xsd:dateTimes</code>.</p>


<pre>prov:endedAtTime   owl:propertyChainAxiom (
      time:hasEnd
      time:inXSDDateTime
    ) ;
.
prov:startedAtTime owl:propertyChainAxiom (
      time:hasBeginning

</section>

<section class="appendix" id="changes">
<h2>Changes from previous versions</h2>
<p>This version of OWL-Time was developed in the Spatial Data on the Web Working Group 
(a joint activity involving W3C and the Open Geospatial Consortium). 
The Ontology is derived from the one described in the 2006 Draft [[owl-time-20060927]] though the document has been completely re-written.  
The principal technical changes are as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li><code><a href="#time:GeneralDateTimeDescription">:GeneralDateTimeDescription</a></code> and <code><a href="#time:GeneralDurationDescription">:GeneralDurationDescription</a></code> are generalizations of the corresponding classes from the 2006 draft, for cases which the temporal reference system is not fixed to the Gregorian Calendar in advance</li>
  <li>the property <code><a href="#time:hasTRS">:hasTRS</a></code> enables time values to be associated with a temporal reference system, represented by a new ('stub') class <code><a href="#time:TRS">:TRS</a></code></li>
  <li><code><a href="#time:TimePosition">:TimePosition</a></code> and <code><a href="#time:Duration">:Duration</a></code> are new classes to enable position or duration to be described using a number or nominal value </li>
  <li>the (super-)classes <code><a href="#time:TemporalPosition">:TemporalPosition</a></code> and <code><a href="#time:TemporalDuration">:TemporalDuration</a></code> are introduced as roots of the position and duration class hierarchies</li>
  <li><code><a href="#time:TemporalUnit">:TemporalUnit</a></code> is a subclass of <code><a href="#time:TemporalDuration">:TemporalDuration</a></code></li>
  <li><code><a href="#time:inXSDDateTimeStamp">:inXSDDateTimeStamp</a></code> added, and <code><a href="#time:inXSDDateTime">:inXSDDateTime</a></code> deprecated</li>
  <li><code><a href="#time:intervalIn">:intervalIn</a></code> and <code><a href="#time:intervalDisjoint">:intervalDisjoint</a></code> relations added</li>
  <li>introduce predicate <code><a href="#time:hasTime">:hasTime</a></code> to enable a <code><a href="#time:TemporalEntity">:TemporalEntity</a></code> to be associated with anything </li>
  <li>deprecate the property <code>:xsdDateTime</code> deprecated as used on <code><a href="#time:DateTimeInterval">:DateTimeInterval</a></code> - difficult/ambiguous encoding</li>
  <li><code>:Year</code> deprecated</li>
  <li><code>:January</code> deprecated</li>
  <li><code><a href="#time:MonthOfYear">:MonthOfYear</a></code> class and <code><a href="#time:monthOfYear">:monthOfYear</a></code> property added. greg:January-greg:December instances added in a separate graph and namespace.</li>
  <li>the time-zone ontology presented in the 2006 draft has been removed. A new class <code><a href="#time:TimeZone">:TimeZone</a></code> in the main namespace is used instead. The new class is a 'stub' with no properties, to serve as a superclass for any implementation</li>
  <li>added data-type property <code><a href="#time:hasXSDDuration">time:hasXSDDuration</a></code> with domain <code>:TemporalEntity</code> and range <code>xsd:duration</code> </li>
  </ul>
<p>The 2021 update added the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>clarifications to the textual definitions of <code><a href="#time:after">:after</a></code> and <code><a href="#time:before">:before</a></code></li>
  <li>add temporal units <code><a href="#time:unitCentury">:unitCentury</a></code>, <code><a href="#time:unitDecade">:unitDecade</a></code>, <code><a href="#time:unitMillenium">:unitMillenium</a></code></li>
  <li>addition of <a href="#iana-links">IANA Considerations</a> to support registration of link relations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Response to Requirements identified in working group analysis</h2>
<p>A number of requirements relating to Time were identified in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#arTimeOntologyInOWL">Spatial
Data on the Web Use Cases &amp; Requirements</a> [[sdw-ucr]]. This section provides brief descriptions of how these requirements have been resolved. </p>

  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#ValidTime">5.56 Valid time</a>: not resolved explicitly. A specialization of <code><a href="#time:hasTime">time:hasTime</a></code> can be used</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#TemporalVagueness">5.49 Temporal vagueness</a>: not addressed explicitly, but <a href="#topology">interval relations</a> single-ended intervals may be used for some cases</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#TimeSeries">5.51 Time series</a>: out of scope for OWL-Time which is concerned with the representation of the temporal aspects only. <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/spatial/wiki/Coverages_in_Linked_Data">Coverages in Linked Data</a> provides some support</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#SpaceTimeMultiScale">5.39 Space-time multi-scale</a>: OWL-Time supports the representation of the temporal properties of things, so may be used as a component of an integrated solution, but the latter is out of scope for this document. </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#4DModelSpaceTime">5.22 4D model of space-time</a>: OWL-Time supports the representation of time that may be used in 4D applications. In particular the classes <code><a href="#time:Duration">time:Duration</a></code> and <code><a href="#time:TimePosition">time:TimePosition</a></code> support descriptions of time duration as a scaled number, and time position as a time coordinate. </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#Provenance">5.32 Provenance</a>: individuals from classes in the <code><a href="#time:TemporalEntity">time:TemporalEntity</a></code> hierarchy may be used in the description of activities involved in provenance traces. <code><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/#Activity">prov:Activity</a></code> could itself be modelled as an <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> of <code><a href="#time:TemporalEntity">time:TemporalEntity</a></code>. Allen's interval algebra described in <a href="#topology">topology</a> can support the description of temporal relationships between activities in a provenance trace. However, these applications have not been explicitly modelled in this document.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-ucr/#MultilingualSupport">5.25 Multilingual support</a>: all labels and other annotations in the ontology have correct language tags. Individuals from the classes <code><a href="#time:DayOfWeek">time:DayOfWeek</a></code> and <code><a href="#time:MonthOfYear">time:MonthOfYear</a></code> have labels in several languages in the RDF artefacts. </li>
